"“Gentle nose gives way to soft citrus sweetness in the sip that pulses in waves. Nicely balanced on the light side of the witbier spectrum with apparent but not excessive yeast esters. Very light yet interesting depth. A touch of bitterness rolls in under those gentle orange waves, offering structure without weighing it down.”",Upland Brewing Wheat Ale,/review/wheat-ale
"“A propulsive aroma with familiar hefe notes of sweet banana and clove melds into a structured body with a touch of hops bitterness that keeps the beer honest and avoids the typical clichés. Like a muscled linebacker, the body is big but lean, efficient, and quick on its toes, and the deft handling of yeast produces a level of sophistication that’s hard to beat.”",Live Oak Hefeweizen,/review/liveoakhefeweizen
"“Softly sweet passion fruit on the nose is subtle but distinctive. The flavor, however, is intensely passion fruit—overwhelmingly so—at the expense of any base-beer character. It does, thankfully, steer clear of the worst phenolic excesses of the fruit, with a seltzer-like spritzy body that finishes clean. Light, tart, crisp, and fruity.”",Ecliptic Brewing Cassiopea Catharina,/review/cassiopea-catharina
"“Crisp yet mild lemony acidity in the flavor is punctuated by a light nose that only hints at the tartness. It’s clean and succinct, not too sweet and not too dry, like a San Pellegrino Limonata with its own adult kick.”",Creature Comforts Athena (2019),/review/athena2019
"“Musty, earthy hops and a touch of Colombian coffee on the nose. The flavor leans toward hops-derived citrus, that earthy tea blend of lemon and lime with a subtle spice underpinning it. It’s clever yet satisfying, eschewing more obvious Citra notes in favor of a winding, complex path to a similar destination.”",Brooklyn Brewery Bel Air Sour,/review/bel-air-sour
“Very subtle tartness and fruit on the nose with some chalky fermentation character that transitions to crisp and crackery on the sip. Peppery notes keep it brisk and bright. The 6-pack abs of witbiers.”,Allagash Brewing White,/review/white
"“Strong lemon on the nose overpowers everything. On the sip, the hops push forward with a balanced bitterness over the citrus bite. It flirts with lemon-cleaner disaster but pulls through in the finish with a balance of sweet and sour.”",Silver City Neon Bloom,/review/neon-bloom
"“It forgoes the expected sour intensity in favor of a measured acidity that’s both palatable and endearing. The deep pink color is fascinating, and any expected excessive fruit acidity is quickly tempered by a smoothie-like softness.”",Odell Brewing Sippin' Pretty ,/review/sippin-pretty
"“Overt sweet orange citrus on the nose, then the sweetness subsides as a distinct herbal bitterness dominates the palate with glimpses of that citrus peeking through.”",New Belgium Fat Tire Belgian White,/review/fat-tire-belgian-white
"“Caramel apple, sandalwood, and a touch of musk and clove on the nose. The sip is toffee, bittersweet apple, almond butter, and wormwood baked into the most savory loaf of banana nut bread you’ve ever tasted. Finishes bright with a palate-cleansing sensation that belies its murky brown body. A mind-bending beer that defies any visual expectations ascribed to it.”",Live Oak  Primus Weizenbock ,/review/primus-weizenbock
"“Hops push a deliciously deceiving citrus nose, but the flavor makes their contribution more apparent with a firm but palatable bitterness that sets this hoppy wheat apart. It’s not a full-on IPA, but what appear to be late-addition and cold-side hops turn this run-of-the-mill wheat into something more interesting to today’s hops fans.”",Breckenridge Brewery Snow Glare,/review/snow-glare
"“Slightly phenolic-leaning, with an herbal-tea character more than clove that adds depth. Finishes a touch sweeter than some to balance the spice, but a pleasant beer nonetheless.”",Telegraph Brewing White ale,/review/white-ale
"“Tangy carbonic bite pushes in front of a soft wheat character but quickly drops off into less body than one might expect from a hefe. A touch thin and a bit light on character and personality, as it foregoes yeast esters for a more accessible drinkability.”",Squatters American Wheat Hefeweizen,/review/american-wheat-hefeweizen
"“Bursting with pie spice, dark cherry, pie crust, and a sweet yet savory and meaty cherry note, it finishes with an almost Dr. Pepper–like plum and fig richness.”",Commonhouse Aleworks Barony Whipper,/review/barony-whipper
“Pillowy lemon softness gently rolls across your tongue with a taut and economical body. But it finishes snappy with a hint of lemon-peel bitterness.”,Brasserie du Bocq Blanche de Namur (2019),/review/blanche-de-namur2019
"“Big and bold hefeweizen nose with balanced esters and phenols cranked up in intensity. Drops into a relatively dry mid sip and a clean finish. Soft, inviting but not sweet or flabby, and hopped with a deft hand.”",Troegs Brewing Dream Weaver Wheat,/review/dream-weaver-wheat
"“Intense blueberry on the nose offers an enticing aroma that draws you in, yet the fruit character falls off in the sip into a slightly bitter and thin body. The aroma is the star of the show, but it’s enticing and draws you into a beer that’s much more drinkable than some of its cloying contemporaries.”",Wasatch Blueberry Hefeweizen,/review/blueberry-hefeweizen
"“A general wheatiness underpins the nose and flavor, but an embrace of broad drinkability bypasses any distinct approach to character—it’s a wallflower.”",Epic Brewing Intermountain Wheat,/review/intermountain-wheat
“Kudos to the brewer for tackling such a flavor-forward beer that sacrifices so much beer history to the altar of audience-pleasing flavor. It’s a confident move that could have backfired. We hate ourselves for wanting more.”,Bouevard Brewing Bou Lou,/review/bou-lou
"“Light toasty wheat-bread nose with hints of honey and pine forest in the summer sun. On the sip, doughy with bit of sweet caramel and orange peel.”",Andechser  Weissbier Dunkel,/review/weissbier-dunkel
"“A mild nose belies a big flavor as a touch of American-style bitterness plays off citrus fruitiness in the sip. It finishes with a cleansing bitterness, but a touch of savory citrus zest lingers on.”","Westbound & Down Don't Hassle the ""Hef""",/review/dont-hassle-the-hef
"A fruity nose sets up an expectation for a sweet beer, but the light and attenuated body delivers a sip that’s less cloying than one would expect. Still, it’s a touch watery, and if you go looking for the roundness of a wheat beer, you’ll be looking past your next sip.”",Wasatch Apricot Hefeweizen,/review/apricot-hefeweizen
“A savory and borderline smoky nose sets up this lower-key kettle sour that trades fruitiness for a richness that could be confused for a brown-ale body. It’s intriguing yet confounding.”,Perrin Brewing Dragon Fruit Berliner,/review/dragon-fruit-berliner
"“Nose is balanced between beer character and fruit notes—a touch of sulfur adds a Pilsner- or Kölsch-style note with hints of fruit in the background. On the sip, the fruit is equally balanced and not overwhelming, and the touch of bitterness adds to the drinkability.”",Kona Brewing  Wailua Wheat,/review/wailua-wheat
"“A citrus-leaning nose with some of the familiar banana and clove transitions into a spicy sip with lemongrass and a bit of herbal bite. Sits wide on the tongue with a lingering fruitiness, while a yeast bitterness barrels down the middle.”",KC Bier Co Hefeweizen,/review/KChefeweizen
,Badger State Brewing Cran-Delusion,/review/cran-delusion
"“Bright fruity nose with a PEZ Candy chalkiness. Flavor is more citrus than typical yeast notes, but it’s lively and energetic without observation squashing its quantum possibility. Not quite as crisp as some, but a pleasant sip.”",Avery Brewing White Rascal (2019),/review/white-rascal2019
"“An outrageously magenta color sets up wild expectations. The flavor is equal parts earthy, sweet, and acidic, with a balanced sourness that highlights the fruitier elements without seeming cliché. A subtle spice underpins it, offering structure but no bitterness.”

",Ska Brewing Pink Vapor Stew,/review/pink-vapor-stew
"“Herbal-tea notes on the nose steer just clear of potpourri, but a spicy body backed by sweet grapefruit and orange esters make for a characterful take on the traditional style.”",Schneider Weisse Edel-Weisse,/review/edel-weisse
"“An uneventfully soft nose blooms into a brightly bitter, pithy grapefruit/lime/Meyer-lemon note. It’s in your face and unapologetic, hinting at sweet but never cloying, and crisply tart in the finish. At first take, it’s a bit unyielding, but further sips confirm that it’s curiously sophisticated.”",MadTree Brewing Poets,/review/poets
"“A touch of fruit and spice in the nose, but the flavor fires big salvos of berries backed by spice depth. It’s not a sweetly one-note beer but rather savory and rich with bright highlights of sweet acidity. Beautiful color.”",Finback Brewery BlueShift,/review/blueshift
"“Satisfying raspberry on the nose with a bright fruit character that seems effortless and natural. On the sip, it’s a well-made raspberry wheat—clean, crisp, assertively fruit- forward. Solidly American in its construction and exactly as advertised. Great clarity in the fruit character.”",Eddyline  Raspberry Wheat,/review/raspberry-wheat
"“A touch chalky on the nose, and the sip seems undefined with vague hints of bubblegum and the mildest Asian spice. Would pair well with Indian or Thai curry.”",Funkwerks White,/review/funkwerkswhite
"“Mild and understated in the nose with a vague medicinal note. A bit flat and undercarbonated, which adds a weight that pulls it down. We’re left wanting more definition, more focus as it plods through the sip.”",50 West Brewing Doom Pedal,/review/doom-pedal
N/A,Second Self Beer Thai Wheat,/review/thai-wheat
“A clean nose with a cucumber-like refreshing note. Flavor underscores that cucumber brightness as a light acidity and just a touch of bready malt provide some substance to the sip.”,Fernson Brewing Curio,/review/curio
"“Brief intro of American-style bitterness keeps it cleaner and more direct, adds a sharpness over the sweet orange blossom–honey nose from the malt. Not particularly wheaty or soft, but a middle-of-the-road drinker.”",Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat (2018),/review/unfiltered-wheat2018
“Flabby but gratuitous with an amorphous yet unspecific nose. The body vacillates between lilting bitterness and a broad fruitiness. A better cuddle partner than workout pal.”,Badger State Brewing Waloon Witbier,/review/waloon-witbier
“The sip hits squarely orange with just a touch of sweetness and a pleasant pithy bitterness that keeps it from being cloying. Finishes with lingering orange candy.”,Verboten Brewing TOSO,/review/toso
"“The intense orange color tells you exactly what this beer intends to be. It’s sweet. It’s not hefe-like in the least. It’s a slightly alcoholic soda with a vaguely hefe base, but it’s better than those adjectives suggest thanks to the quality of fruit flavor.”",Schofferhofer Hefeweizen Grapefruit,/review/hefeweizen-grapefruit
"“Visually smart, with a perfect golden haze. Light bready nose and body trending toward the thin side, but the banana-orange notes build with additional sips—this is one to drink by the pint, not the taster.”",Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen,/review/pyramidhefeweizen
"“Soft malt sweetness and a touch of grassy hops in the nose lead into a bright citrusy, high-key, effervescent sip with a carbonic bite that rolls into a touch of earthy bitterness in the finish. Not as malt-heavy as some.”",Odell Brewing Easy Street Wheat,/review/easy-street-wheat2018
"“Blurring the lines between IPA and wheat, this ‘New England Wheat’ is heavy with American hops on the nose. It is the hophead’s wheat—onion and garlic hops notes, a bit of juiciness, and not a whole lot of beer in there to support the strong hops notes. But all critiques aside, we’d take this over most session IPAs.”",Lord Hobo Brewing Angelica,/review/angelica
"“Only the briefest hit of honey malt comes through in the search for a nose, but the sip brings more oxidative honey heft and an indistinct bitterness.”",Erdinger Weissbier,/review/erdingerweissbier
"“Clean and well-made with some sweetness and coffee flavors mixed with smoked herring and a touch of barbecue. There’s subtle malt complexity, almost like a light rauchbier. Very light overall.”",Aslan Brewing Dunkelweizen,/review/dunkelweizen
"“A yeasty nose with light hits of lemon and orange. Body is light but supportive. Carbonation is lively and bright. The sum is a hefe that feels lighter than its apparent ABV, weightless but not as strong in character and flavor as others.”",1623 Brewing Hefeweizen,/review/1623hefeweizen
"“A classic hefe nose with mid-level yeast character that hits the golden mean. Flavor is familiar and comforting, with a lively body. Maybe a touch sweet in a critical estimation, but the character of the flavor won us over.”",Starr Hill Brewery The Love,/review/the-love
"“A clinically synthetic mango nose leaves no question what is in the beer. On the sip, the apparent sweetness fades, and the borderline phenolic mango note clashes with a building bitterness, leading to an unresolved battle in the lingering finish.”",Blue Moon Mango Wheat,/review/mango-wheat
"“A muted nose blunts the initial impact, and an American hand at hopping offers a bit more bitterness as the mild herbal notes overpower the yeast. It’s not bitter, per se, but more firm than flowe",Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,/review/widmerhefeweizen
"“Tanned leather and fresh tobacco leaf on the nose hint at the age. Flavor is candied orange, tree bark, fruit gummy. Age has not been kind to this beer, and it’s not nearly as satisfying as we’d assume it would be, fresh.”",Wektenburger Kloster  Hefeweisbier,/review/hefeweisbier
"“Soft and creamy nose with a touch of dried flower and strawberry smoothie. On the sip, dried hibiscus tea that avoids any connotation of sweet in favor of a layered herbal approach. Thoughtfully constructed.”",Upland Brewing Petal to the Kettle (2019),/review/UPLANDpetal-to-the-kettle
"“Bright and bubbly with orange and tangerine notes emerging from an energetic and lively body. It has all the pep of a high-school cheerleader, but finishes reasonably dry in a drinkable way.”",Ritual Brewing Wit's End,/review/wits-end
"“The first whiff is more bitter than expected, but that doesn’t carry through to the sip as an orange-lime sweetness pulls through with a hint of citric tartness.”",Pinkus Hefe Weizen,/review/pinkushefe-weizen
"“A funky nose of pineapple and citrus evokes fruit cocktail without the cloying sweetness. On the sip, it’s warming and more pineapple fruit cup. More dry than expected, with a quality of pineapple that delivers on the promise. Meaty and substantial, it’s a bigger sip than you might expect from such a low ABV beer.”",Creature Comforts Tritonia,/review/tritonia
"“Where’s the line between Gose and sour IPA? This beer flaunts the deficiencies in definition—it doesn’t capture the fruit juiciness of sour IPAs but delivers far more hops than a typical Gose as the acid and bitterness create a bit of a jumble.”

",Black Shirt Brewing Slant Rhyme,/review/slant-rhyme
"“Visually, more fruit smoothie than beer—thick, opaque, and merlot in color. The nose is all sweet berries, and the flavor leaves us looking for some sort of beer complexity.”",Mikerphone Brewing Bass Cannon,/review/bass-cannon
“Shoe leather and light citrus on the nose. A bright and bready body like an orange breakfast pastry.”,Andechser  Weissbier Hell,/review/weissbier-hell
"“Most Goses don’t focus on the salt, but this beer celebrates it. The acidity is tightly controlled and accents subtle lime notes that exude the confidence and sophistication of a finely made cocktail. It’s a bright and refreshing beer.”",Dogfish Head SeaQuench Ale,/review/seaquench-ale
"“A faint whiff of sharpie on the nose that fades into a vague cucumber-lime. The sip is effervescent, with tight carbonation on the tongue and orange and tangerine notes coming to the fore. It finishes faster than most, with a lingering orange-zest note and a dryness that’s inviting.”",Sketchbook Brewing Cumulus,/review/cumulus
"“An unfortunate whiff of oxidation on the nose—a mix of sweetness, old milk, and long overripe fruit. On the palate, it’s a bit more enjoyable, with bright carbonation and subtle lemon and lime notes.”",Ayinger Brauweisse,/review/brauweisse
Rich caramel and chocolate in the flavor. Almost like a Tootsie Roll. Moderate strong sweetness up front that slowly fades into a moderately dry finish. Slight moderate bitterness and a bit of alcohol warmth help balance as well. The toasty malt flavors dry out the finish.,Weihenstephan Korbinian,/review/korbinian
"Rich bread-crust melanoidin malt character comes through more in the flavor, which has moderate sweetness and low bitterness. Low levels of herbal and grassy hops also come through in the flavor. Molasses, peat smoke, chocolate-coated orange, bread crust, and stewed prunes. Clean lager fermentation characteristics give it a clean finish with a hint of roasted malt and smoke without being harsh and smoky or peaty. Light body overall.",Samuel Adams Black Lager,/review/black-lager
"Prominent smooth, creamy milk chocolate and coffee. Low supporting hops. Spicy woody alcohol flavor. Complex malt richness with toffee and coconut is accentuated by the barrel-aged qualities that add a tannic wood dryness, some toasted coconut, and a pleasant underlying boozy warmth. Finish is rich, but not overly cloying.",Jack's Abby Barrel-Aged Framinghammer,/review/barrel-aged-framinghammer
"The flavor is also delicate with more bready and lighter fruit character. Low sweetness into very low bitterness. Well-balanced with a slightly hops-forward, but still crisp, finish. Very refreshing.",Exhibit 'A' Goody Two Shoes,/review/goody-two-shoes
"Well-crafted malt complexity with depth of Continental base-malt character. The light sweetness of the malt works perfectly with the fruity esters and floral hops. Quite delicate, but with a zing from tangerine and lemongrass notes. Finishes smooth and dry.”",Chapman All Clear Kölsch,/review/all-clear-koelsch
"Light sweetness into light bitterness and very light acidity. Light body and a dry finish. Clean and simple malt profile with a hint of corn. Clean floral, perfumy, and slightly citrus hops. Slight mineral characteristic. Super well-balanced with a very crisp and dry finish that is not overtly bitter.",Prost Brewing Kölsch,/review/koelsch
Still malt-focused with bready malt up front. Moderate sweetness morphs into slight bitterness. A bit more floral hops and more lemon and orange fruity esters join the mix. Dry finish that ends quickly without any lingering bitterness. Refreshing.”,Firestone Walker 805,/review/805
"Bright, crisp malt sweetness up front, but well-balanced with fruity esters and floral-hops character. Neither lingers too long. The beer starts very bright and strong but almost immediately mellows and dissipates, encouraging more sips. Spicy pear esters, light citrus and herbal hops, and grainy malt lead to a smooth slightly dry finish.",Southern Tier 8 Days A Week,/review/8-days-a-week
"Medium toast, light caramel sweetness. Subtle minty hops flavor. Balance tips mostly to malt with toffee and raisin. The finish is caramel-focused and dry, with a bit of toasted walnut astringency.",Prost Dunkel,/review/dunkelprost
"Toffee-like, rich and chewy, with an almost buttery character. Comes across a bit thick, but not overly cloying on balance. Finish is relatively dry and has a noticeable alcoholic heat without being harsh or burning. Barrel character isn’t particularly distinctive, but it smooths out the complex flavors to give them a more refined character.",Jack's Abby Eis Maker,/review/eis-maker
"For as much as the barrel dominates the nose, it’s more balanced in the flavor. Still some cola notes with some dark melanoidin malt sweetness, but the roast is a bit more pronounced and works well with the vanilla and coconut character from the barrel. Alcohol and bourbon are especially strong in aftertaste.",Perrin Brewing Black Goat,/review/black-goat
"Simple but balanced. It starts off with moderately low sweetness and blossoms into a low hops bitterness but with a dry finish that’s crisp and refreshing. There’s a lot to like from citrus and melon hops, toasted malt, apple and pear esters, somewhat mineraly bitterness, and a mildly cloying sweet finish. Moderate carbonation gives it a bit of bite.”",New Belgium Brewing Dayblazer,/review/dayblazer
"More rich and toasty malts with hints of coffee, smoke, and bitter chocolate. Moderate sweetness morphs into a moderately low bitterness.",Fiction Beer Alternate Present,/review/alternate-present
Upfront roast with notes of coffee and charred malt with no astringency or unneeded lingering. Toasted bread crust. Very crushable. Peat smoke and bready malt lead to a smooth and balanced finish that is remarkably clean and refreshing.,Creature Comforts The Silent World,/review/the-silent-world
"Bright nutty character, almost peanut-like, up front. Floral hops notes emerge more as it warms. Low carbonation and body, but both are appropriate to style. The finish is biscuit malt mixed with apple and pear esters balanced with light earthy hops, low bitterness, and smooth finish.",Chapman Dispense as Written,/review/dispense-as-written
"The malt has some nice toffee and dark cherry character, but it’s a bit overwhelmed by the roast astringency that overpowers things a bit. Some caramelized sweetness dances around to help mellow it overall. The finish is dry, with lingering coffee and grassy hop bitterness.",Wibby Moondoor Dunkel,/review/moondoor-dunkel
The vanilla really comes through in the flavor with a lot of rich malt and chocolate. There’s a nuttiness as well and a slight moderate sweetness up front that builds into a moderately strong sweetness before fading. The whole combination reminds one of Little Debbie Nutty Bars. The finish has a moderate bitterness and a low alcohol warmth.,Wibby Double Dunkel,/review/double-dunkel
"Deep, deep dark chocolate malt, very clean fermentation. Light floral hops provide low supporting bitterness. Finishes a bit sweet with roast for days.",Jack's Abby Framinghammer,/review/framinghammer
"A pronounced sweetness that slowly fades and is balanced by fairly strong alcohol. Bourbon-barrel oak, toffee, bready malt, stewed plums, big dose of hot alcohol, very drying. Alcohol spiciness is probably enhanced with noble hops. Finishes like a boozy Belgian dark strong or a candy bar.",Heavy Seas Schnee Boot,/review/schnee-boot
"Rich and complex malt—coffee, toffee, figs, dried fruit. Finish has hints of grassy hops, a slight dark-malt tartness, with lingering toffee, chocolate, and a bit of alcoholic heat. Balance is slightly sweet, but not cloying, which accentuates the soft, creamy finish. Some nice chocolate notes in aftertaste.",Dust Bowl Brewing Public Enemy,/review/public-enemy
"Moderately strong milk chocolate in the flavor with toast and rich malt behind it. A moderate sweetness slowly fades and is a touch cloying in the finish. Bitterness is very low. Other than the lingering sweetness, the finish is clean with a light lasting dark malt flavor.",Deschutes/Bell's Schwarzbier,/review/Deschutesschwarzbier
"Bread, crackers, and crust come through in the flavor with more herbal, grassy, and a bit piney hops character. Well-balanced with moderate carbonation, a slightly dry and bitter finish, but not astringent. The esters are now more pear-like.”",Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold,/review/buffalo-gold
"Moderately strong chocolate in the flavor. Sweet caramel, toffee, roast, slight smoke, dried fruits (raisin, prune). Sweet floral hops. Clean lager characteristics. Distinct alcoholic warmth that is not harsh or boozy but definitely noticeable. Well-balanced. Slightly sweet smooth finish that is on the drier side of sweet. Wonderful malt complexity!",Wasatch Brewery Devastator,/review/devastator
"Just like on the aroma, hops flavors dominate and are punched up by the light malt sweetness. Bitterness is surprisingly restrained for the intense hops flavors. Still, there’s a sweet malt backbone.",Prison City Seward's Folly,/review/sewards-folly
Hops come through more in the flavor with the herbal and lemon becoming more of a lemongrass character. Malt is still in the background but akin to sweet biscuit. There’s a soapy finish that’s also dry and slightly bitter but not astringent. A light mineral character may be accentuated by the moderate carbonation level.”,Perrin Brewing Gold,/review/brewing-gold
"Still malt-focused in the flavor with more grainy, herbal, and grassy character. Moderately low sweetness into a finish that’s dry with moderately low bitterness and very low acidity. Very clean.",Left Hand Travelin' Light Kölsch,/review/travelin-light-koelsch
"Toasty, bready crust, and nutty come through in the flavor as well. There’s also a hint of caramel. Moderate sweetness carries through into the finish with low bitterness. Grassy, grainy malt, bread crust, coffee, medium-full body with semisweet finish. Slight noble, floral, spicy hops. Well-balanced. Crisp finish with a slight lingering sweetness but not cloying.",Kansas City Bier Dunkel,/review/dunkel
More smoke with underlying toasty malt. Nice malt flavors. Some toasty chocolate notes. A touch of sweetness in the start that is well- balanced out in the finish.,Jack's Abby Smoke & Dagger,/review/smoke-and-dagger
"Toasty rich malt (like toasted bread or graham cracker), but not overly sweet or thick on the palate. Nice clean, crisp, drying finish, almost husky, with some hops bitterness to balance as well.",Jack's Abby Red Tape,/review/red-tape
"Prominent creamy cocoa. Tastes like a Tootsie Roll—mild chocolate, toffee, with an underlying toffee sweetness. Finish isn’t overwhelmingly sweet because there’s enough hops bitterness to balance and keep it from being cloying. Some nice warmth to the finish as well. Will make you think of a chocolate milk shake.”",Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock,/review/chocolate-bock
Rich and malt-forward in the flavor as well. Sweet. Clean lager fermentation characteristics. Noticeable alcoholic warmth that accentuates some dryness in the finish.”,Kansas City Bier Co. Winterbock,/review/winterbock
"Clean. Roast chocolate and coffee. Light green pepper. Mild supporting hops balance the malt and coffee. Nice coffee flavors, medium sweet.",Hardywood Baltic Sunrise,/review/baltic-sunrise
"The flavor is still barrel-forward, but the malt helps balance it a bit more. Aged chocolate-covered cherries soaked in bourbon, raisins, warming spicy alcohol. Alcohol lingers pleasantly into the finish.",Grand Teton Double Vision 2015,/review/double-vision-2015
"Apricot-dominant. Distinct apricot flavors that incorporate aspects of both flesh and skin. Slight floral and perfumy hops flavors help cut through some of the fruit sweetness, without lowering the overall impact of the fruit. Fruit notes are slightly acidic and crisp. More ‘beer’ character emerges in the flavor, so it’s not all fruit. Pretty well-balanced. Slightly tart finish.",Dry Dock Apricot Blonde,/review/apricot-blonde
"A medium amount of malt sweetness is well-balanced with an appropriate level of hops character. The sweetness enhances some of the citrus notes, giving it a slight mandarin-orange character with melon. Moderate carbonation, which helps to accentuate the dryness.",Cigar City Golden Ale,/review/golden-ale
"Simple base malt backbone. Floral, soapy, and slightly citrus-hops flavors. Slightly peppery and spicy. Moderate carbonation enhances a crisp effervescence and pronounced bitterness with a slightly sweet finish. It hits most of the notes in safe and expected ways, but there’s just a hint of clash between the resinous woodier elements of the hops and the ester component.",Brasserie St. James The Koln Concert,/review/the-koln-concert
"Light bready malt and a touch of banana esters continue onto the palate. There’s a moderately low sweetness that transitions into moderately low bitterness. The finish is dry, reminiscent of a fruit cocktail and very clean with a lingering bitterness.",Boulevard Beer American Kolsch,/review/american-kolsch
"Starts with a touch of malt sweetness and light yeast esters and then just drops into an intense hops bomb with a lingering bitterness. Woody, herbal, and like an orange slice in a cup of tea. The malt tries to balance out with a bit of sweetness, but eventually loses out to the sticky bitterness.”",Surly First Avenue +1,/review/first-avenue-1
"Still clove-forward on the front, but the hops come through more on the palate with lemon, grassy, and grapefruit character. Low sweetness and low bitterness. This is almost like a spiced holiday wine. Moderate carbonation accentuates a crisp finish. A bit fuller in body than a ‘traditional’ blonde.",Perennial Southside Blonde,/review/southside-blonde
"Sweet melanoidin malt character up front, middle roast notes. Decent amount of body to support the flavors. Slight floral and soapy noble-hops flavors. Sweet dark bready malt, toffee, and coffee.",New Belgium Brewing 1554,/review/1554
"There’s a nice underlying chocolate malt with a rich a complex spice character from the chai. Great finish—the roast chocolate flavors pair nicely with the spice additions, and while it’s a bit dry and puckering, it doesn’t cross into harsh and astringent territory.",WeldWerks Chai Baltic Porter,/review/chai-baltic-porter
"Earthy hops notes carry the front, with some light chicken stock and woodsy notes. A touch of carbonation to heighten the beer’s flavors. Malt character is very subtle with just a touch of cracker and biscuit. Dry but crisp finish with a slight lingering mouth-coating bitterness.",Squatters Chasing Tail Orange Golden Ale,/review/chasing-tail-orange-golden-ale
"There’s a lot of hops complexity. Bold citrus with a lemongrass focus. Malt flavors get lost in the shuffle. Light, clean body. Bitter and dry finish with a lingering hops-derived bitterness.",Lawson's Finest Liquids Above the Clouds,/review/above-the-clouds
"Roasted malt, caramel, coffee, slight chocolate. Slight floral/spicy hops. Clean lager fermentation. Noticeable, but not harsh, alcoholic warmth. Slightly sweet (but not cloying) finish that is dried out a bit by the alcohol. Some strong earthy mushroom notes add an umami richness to it.",Epic Brewing Double Skull,/review/double-skull
"More raspberry. Slight moderate sweetness into slight acidity and very low bitterness. Well-balanced with a nice interplay of malt, fruit, and clean hops. Finish is pleasantly dry and crisp with a smack of tart. The quality of the raspberry flavor is fantastic—natural, deep, and nuanced.",Denver Beer Princess Yum Yum Raspberry Kolsch,/review/princess-yum-yum-raspberry-kolsch
Sweet caramel malt with some biscuit. A light hops spice character in the melon and berry family emerges before it finishes a bit sweet and quite dry (almost wine-like) with some esters of stone fruit—plum and cherry. Very restrained bitterness.,Deep Ellum Dallas Blonde,/review/dallas-blonde
Well-balanced with some upfront malt sweetness with a well-placed amount of bitterness to keep things in check. A touch of fruity yeast and hops-flavor complexity adds to some depth. Nice crisp finish with a perfect amount of carbonation. Quite palate cleansing.”,Call to Arms Tennyson Standard,/review/tennyson-standard
"Roasted malt with a focus on dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Floral hops are slightly more pronounced than one would expect. A slight huskiness that approaches tannic or astringent. Finishes quite dry and slightly bitter with bits of caramel lingering into the aftertaste. It lacks the refinement of some others in the style, but that extra personality is endearing at times.”",Dust Bowl Brewing Steinbock,/review/steinbock
"Very rich toast, chocolate, and coffee. Moderately sweet. The hops just balance the sweetness. Slight green-pepper back note. Finishes a touch on the sweet side. Malt holds on awhile. Coffee bitterness comes through on the finish, but given the lingering sweetness, it balances well.",Crooked Stave Coffee Baltic Porter,/review/crookedstavecoffee-baltic-porter
More toasty popcorn kernel and chocolate malt in the flavor with much less smoke. Moderate sweetness into moderate bitterness in the flavor. Clean lager profile. Finish is slightly bitter with a hint of smoke or peat that lingers. Good balance on the sweetness.,Uinta Brewing Baba Black Lager,/review/baba-black-lager
"Very light berry note with neutral malt character. Sweet malt backbone. Sweet citrus (orange, lemon) and floral hops that lead into sweet yet tart berry-like flavors (strawberry, sweet raspberry, blackberry). Finishes clean and slightly sweet.",Oskar Blues Guns 'N' Rose,/review/guns-n-rose
"Husky malt character that evolves into a mild biscuity sweetness. Some mild hops notes, but a distinct minerality that’s a bit distracting. Light carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Slightly bitter on the finish and lacking crispness.",MadTree Lift,/review/lift
"Hops-forward with mostly lemon and rose. There’s more tea-like hops in the flavor as well. Mouth-coating, dank hoppy finish that is both bitter and slightly astringent. Floral, slightly fruity.",Lawson's Finest Liquids Knockout Blonde,/review/knockout-blonde
Moderate-low dark-fruit flavors of prune and raisin. Moderate roasted malt. Alcoholic warmth that is not harsh or ‘boozy’ but quite noticeable. Low spicy esters. Clean fermentation. Slightly sweet finish with low carbonation.,Chapman I Feel Pretty Doppelbock,/review/i-feel-pretty-doppelbock
"Roasted malt, caramel, biscuit, bread. Clean noble-hops flavors. Slightly complex malty sweet balances the hops. Clean and palate-cleansing.

"Tangerine dominates up front, but it’s not overpowering, and well-balanced with the malt and bitterness. The tea character emerges at the end and lingers, giving a pleasant aftertaste of afternoon tea with biscuits and jam. Relatively thin in body, so it drinks a bit like a lightly sweetened ice tea. Finishes dry mostly from the citric acid.",Suncrush Beer Tangerine Suncrush,/review/tangerine-suncrush

The barrel adds a hazelnut, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, and caramel character.",Ozark Beer BDCS 2018,/review/bdcs-2018

"The malt complexity has dried cherries, prunes, black currants, chocolate, and tobacco but comes across relatively dry on the finish.

The woodsy character adds nice astringency on the finish and adds to the perception of dryness.",Funkwerks Oud Bruin,/review/oud-bruin
"Funky and slightly cinnamon spicy flavors that meld with tart and sour fresh cherries. A slight malty sweetness cuts through the tart fruit and comes across bread-like.

Good carbonation makes it sparkle on the tongue.",Crooked Stave Sour Rose,/review/sour-rose
"Quite lactic and peachy. Juicy, almost citrus. Slightly astringent peach skin. Minimal Brett character. Fairly sour, moderately tart. Finish is a bit mouth-coating.

Everything is in balance.",Crooked Stave Persica 2018,/review/persica-2018
"Crazy and bit disorienting with the first taste. There are a lot of flavors vying for attention all at once. Quite sweet, but this is offset by the spicy roastiness from the coffee.

The finish has strong licorice and vanilla character, with lingering maple-syrup sweetness.",Three Taverns Double Smack,/review/double-smack

Very smooth body with some alcohol warmth and a hint of acidity in the finish that really sells the tropical-juice aroma and flavor. Everything we want in a hazy IPA. Flavor was off the charts.",TrimTab The Original 006,/review/the-original-006
"Like a mango-and-pineapple carbonated milkshake. Large creaminess that suggests the lactose of milkshake IPAs. Tropical fruit dominates with not much else showing up, but there’s a significant bitterness in the background that keeps it from being a cloying experience. A classic NEIPA juice bomb.",Burial Beer Hawkbill,/review/hawkbill
Strawberry shortcake and dank. A nice pine note and the dankness is more reserved and in line with more fruity strains. Malt is a nice support to the hops bitterness.,Tree House Bright,/review/bright
"Dry and light but not too astringent. Hops flavor is crisp, emphasizing the citrus: lemon, lemon balm, and a bit of grapefruit. Definite bitterness, but balanced relative to the dryness. Lemon and peach in the aftertaste. Not unlike a dry white wine or champagne.",Verboten Somebody to Love,/review/somebody-to-love
"The initial citrus-forward palate quickly gives way to a strong peach character. Malt is there to support only but is rich—hints of coffee and nuts—without being sweet. Carbonation is high and smooth. Great execution on that front. Some pine character on the smooth, medium-bitter finish, leaving a lingering impression of chocolate and citrus.",Melvin Brewing Chuck Morris,/review/chuck-morris
"Lush tropical-fruit character—grapefruit and mango paired with a rich, chewy body that doesn’t come across overly sweet, but still balances the hops character well. Bitter finish without being overwhelming. Lingering hints of grapefruit rind and ripe mango, with a soft mineral character. A bit of both worlds.",Hop Butcher The Jewels,/review/the-jewels
"Citrus, peach, and strawberry fruitiness up front, with a pleasantly bitter finish that has hints of lemon and pine. Fantastic chewy body—not overly sweet, but rich and full, with a lingering soft character that isn’t overdone. Slight hops burn on the finish.",Door County Punk Ass Cat,/review/punk-ass-cat
"Lemon and orange flavors immediately up front with a light hops bitterness. Lots of tropical fruit—mango, grapefruit, with a pithy earthiness.

Very light on the bitterness, however, with a touch of spiciness mixed in.",Cerebral Brewing DDH Cheat Code,/review/ddh-cheat-code
"Fruity Pebbles combination of flavors. Tropical-fruit notes of mango, papaya, coconut, and vanilla. Overall, a pretty juicy flavor profile. As it warms, the alcohol becomes more noticeable.

Other tropical fruits peek in and out but are well blended. Slight alcoholic burn on the finish.",Resident Culture Fire Walk With Me,/review/fire-walk-with-me

"Lovely flavor of tropical overripe pineapple and grapefruit. Really nice malt character with some nice hops bitterness that lingers but falls off rather quickly. Really nice sweetness that gives a good balance. What makes a killer beer—it’s all about the mouthfeel, and they nailed it.",Monday Night Brewing Space Lettuce,/review/space-lettuce
"Nice tropical-fruit blend: papaya, coconut, orange, light lemon. Grassy here, too. Mild astringency, and oncoming hops bitterness is a good balance to the sweetness of the initial taste. Finish is smooth and slightly sweet but fairly quick to fade.”",MadTree Brewing Heroes,/review/heroes
Resinous dank hops up front that lead into a low malty sweetness. Balanced decidedly toward sticky grapefruit-forward hops. Good amount of bittering hops bring the clean malt sweetness into balance.,Left Hand Brewing India Pale Ale,/review/india-pale-ale
"Assertive hops flavor and bitterness. Pine resin, some grapefruit, lemon, peach, apricot, and tangerine, plus an earthy foundation. Some of that mint is still here, along with some mild, pleasant esters (cherry, mostly). Perfect malt support. Fairly clean finish, but still a bit of hops flavor to appreciate.",Four Noses Whimsy,/review/whimsy

"Fairly dry despite the sweet aroma. Assertive bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Hops flavor is strong but much simpler: big spruce/pine with a little grapefruit in the aftertaste. There’s some hops astringency, too, with moderate esters. But the bitter hops are the center of attention.”",Crooked Stave IPA,/review/crookedstaveipa

nteresting sugar profile of caramel and white sugar on top of the crazy tropical-fruit and spice blend. Notes of peach leather and strawberries with a strong pineapple component. Chewy as can be with a bit lower carbonation than the style is known for. The caramel comes out pretty strongly in the finish making it a bit weighty even for the ABV.”,Burial Beer To Streak Blood Across My Brow,/review/to-streak-blood-across-my-brow
Bright tropical flavor with a nice lemon and lemongrass note. Slight/low pine character travels right to the back and leaves a lingering bitterness. Really nice bready malt character.

The lemon and herbal grass in the aroma come together as lemongrass in the flavor with just a touch of bready malt to support. Notes of blue cheese and strawberries.

Spicy alcohol notes actually work well here to blend with the rosy hops flavor. Bitterness is moderate but not overpowering. Smooth with the melon flavor dominating the profile.,Founders Sleeper Cell,/review/sleeper-cell
"Grapefruit is more pronounced in the flavor, but the pine is still there. Slight grassy or vegetal note. Bitterness is pronounced and a little pithy, but not harsh.

More bitterness than one expects from the aroma. Juicy tropical hops are enhanced by a candy-like light malt sweetness and backed by a balanced bitterness. Very creamy.,Tired Hands Alien Church,/review/alien-church
"The pineapple slips right into the citrusy tropical-fruit flavor (orange, mango, papaya, coconut) of the hops. It’s a little distinctive because it’s riper than the usual pineapple character. It also adds a balancing tartness that goes well with the lemon/orange citrus. Could use more carbonation to accentuate some of the brighter flavors.",Moksa Brewing Pineapple SUPERFUZZ,/review/pineapple-superfuzz
"Soft and fluffy throughout. Low bitterness with a dry finish. Orange, lemon, lime, peach, and tangerine notes. Body is quite chewy. A mineral-like, chalky mouthfeel hangs out on the finish and magnifies the dryness of the attenuation.",Maplewood Son of Juice,/review/son-of-juice
"Pretty juicy (orange) and not a huge onion bomb that the aroma made it seem like it was going to be. Definitely has alcohol, but it isn’t overpowering. For a high-gravity IPA, this has a good amount of hops flavor (pine, resin, orange) and malt backbone. Balanced toward bitter as it should be, but all in all, it has a lot of other stuff going on.",Finback Brewery Four Year,/review/four-year

"Highly bitter, but enough residual sweetness to make it balanced for the style.

Finish isn’t overly bitter with a slight sweetness on the very end.",Outer Range Pillow Stacks,/review/pillow-stacks
Initial impression: tangerine. Mid-palate: tangerine. Finish: tangerine. Aftertaste: wait for it…tangerine. A light herbal spicy character similar to white pepper appears as it starts to warm.

"Tropical-fruit hops with a grassy, pith-like quality on the finish. Rich and full-bodied, fairly sweet, just short of cloying.

"Base beer seems pretty clean, but there’s so much lime and mango in this ‘beer’ that it is hard to tell. Once the singular fruit flavors fade, there isn’t anything left, no malt body and little to no sweetness. Would benefit from some acidity.",Uinta Mango Lime Pilsner,/review/mango-lime-pilsner
"Rich bready sweetness up front with a lingering toast note, reminiscent of dessert bread. Spicy hops character adds complexity, and a well-balanced bitterness persists through the finish, with a hint of pine and pithy citrus.",Two Roads Ol' Factory Pils,/review/ol-factory-pils
"The medium-sweet backbone is a surprise. Fresh malt, a touch of alcohol, light pine hops aroma. Balancing bitterness, but the impression is more sweet than bitter. More body than some of the others in this style. The aftertaste showcases the hops flavor.",South County 851 Helles,/review/851-helles
"More malt character than most Pilsners, with a prominent biscuit note and a touch of bread crust. Hops bitterness is pronounced and lingers, which mutes any hops flavors, but some pine and cattiness come through. Finish is slightly sweet and malty for the style, but there’s also a grainy bite to balance.",Night Shift Brewing Pfaffenheck,/review/pfaffenheck
Slightly pine-like and resinous hops flavors that become more perfumy and herbaceous as they linger. A slight ‘papery’ or cardboard-like flavor that isn’t quite oxidization. Subtle sweet malt flavors or sweet bread and biscuit. Finishes fairly dry and lightly bitter. A very subtle metallic characteristic on the finish.,Great Lakes Turntable Pils,/review/turntable-pils
"Simple clean malt profile with a delicate balance of floral and sweet, spicy hops flavors. Carbonation is pretty high, giving it a fluffy mouthfeel but also a fairly sharp carbonic bite. The finish is a bit sweet.",FX Matt Brewing Utica Club,/review/utica-club
"Clean Pils malt throughout. Falls slightly sweet on the palate, but the finish is crisp and carries enough bitterness to cut through. Floral and spicy hops notes play well with the malt and bring a nice complexity. Finishes fairly dry with a slight grain-husk tannic bitterness.",Summit Brewing Keller Pils,/review/keller-pils
"A little sweet in the start with a fair amount of bitterness on the finish. In the middle, it’s light clean malt, bread notes, and subtle sweetness. The hops bitterness is restrained.",Firestone Walker Firestone Lager,/review/firestone-lager
"Similar to the aroma, with moderate-to-high perfume and sweet spicy hops flavors. Just enough biscuit and bready malt to keep the balance in check. The spiciness from the hops dances off of the medium carbonation to help lighten what feels like a higher gravity beer.",Alvarado Street Peninsula Pilsner,/review/peninsula-pilsner
Fairly clean lager character throughout with a touch of malt sweetness up front that transitions into a some pithy bitterness. A subtle lingering citrus character competes with a slight hops bite.,Against the Grain Bloody Show,/review/bloody-show
"The blend of phenolics and herbs carries into the palate. Also, a strong smoky and salty character gives the impression of meat. Nice spiced malt sweetness with rye notes that dries out quickly, leaving one to break down the lingering flavors of olive pit, peppercorns, mushroom, umami. Finishes fairly dry and slightly bitter.",Shmaltz Pastrami Pilsner,/review/pastrami-pilsner
"Crisp and refreshing though light-bodied. The malt sweetness is delicate with bread-like sweetness. The hops give complexity of some spice and floral notes but not overpowering. A bit of bitterness, but balanced with the delicateness of this beer.",Widmer Brothers PDX Pils,/review/pdx-pils
"Malt-forward with bread, cracker, and biscuit notes. There’s an almost ‘peanut butter–like’ sweetness. Bitterness is slightly high, but it doesn’t linger, and it does help to cut the sweetness of the malt well. Floral hops notes carry into the finish. The carbonation makes it fluffy before giving way to the bitterness.",Burial Beer Shadowclock Pilsner,/review/shadowclock-pilsner
Moderate biscuit and subtle bread-like malt flavors. Low noble hops flavors that are much in the background. Slightly sticky mouth-coating finish that is more malt than hops. The citrus hops add an unexpected complexity.,Samuel Adams Noble Pils,/review/noble-pils
"Rich and fruity with just enough tartness to bring everything together. Same list of fruit as on the aroma and really nice Brett character. Light hops flavor in the middle of the sip. This has a soft malt body—bready and a bit of oat. Light sweetness throughout with a nice dry, crisp finish.",Hill Farmstead What is Enlightenment,/review/what-is-enlightenment
"Light body, high carbonation, low but balancing bitterness for such a low-gravity beer. Light mint character mixed with a light grapefruit and mango-like flavors. The Brett plays off of a very light malt backbone and carries everything through. Makes the citrus and tropical notes shine.",Birds Fly South Petite Galaxy,/review/petite-galaxy
"West Coast hops to boot, showcasing the piney, resinous character with a touch of light citrus. Light bready malt sweetness pairs well with the softly orange, lemon, and resinous hops character.

"Big citrus and clean medium bitterness up front. Some spice. Nice esters: melon, tropical fruit.",Lagunitas 12th of Never Ale,/review/12th-of-never-ale
"The hops flavor hits with a strong citrus, then fades for a moment to come back as tropical fruit. Punctuated by a fairly clear bitterness that lingers just a bit. The fruit and a bit of returning lime create a lasting aftertaste. Moderate carbonation mixes with the hops to create a pleasant bite at the end of the sip.",Surly Xtra-Citra Pale Ale,/review/xtra-citra-pale-ale
"Moderately fruity up front with melon, lemon, strawberry, and light white grape toward the end. A medium bitterness comes right after the fruit and grows throughout the sip. A light orange Creamsicle sweetness mixes with bitterness toward the end. Finish is soft, with a delicate mineral/chewy mouthfeel. It’s not particularly bitter, just enough to balance and accentuate the fruit on the swallow.",Prison City 4 Piece Pale Ale Citra,/review/4-piece-pale-ale-citra
"Bright citrus character carries through, but any malt character is covered up. Bitterness is spot on. A touch of phenol toward the end of the sip (not uncommon for mango beers) that goes into a fruity tart finish. Like a German stollen (holiday fruitcake)—layered bready malt and fruit notes.",Breckenridge Mango Mosaic,/review/mango-mosaic
"Rich, creamy mouthfeel from the lactose. Rich and fruity, like freshly squeezed OJ, as on the aroma, with low-moderate bitterness that lingers softly on the palate. Finish is lightly bitter and slightly sweet.",South County Sound Machine,/review/sound-machine
"Spicy floral hops (chrysanthemum) hit strong, then medium rich malt, then a solid wall of bitterness to wrap it up. Light bread character in the background.",Ritual Pale Ale,/review/ritual-pale-ale
Big tropical presence from the mango that dances on top of the citrus and floral hops. Low bitterness is countered by moderate carbonation at the end of the sip. This has a touch of fruit tartness and finishes with a light bitterness and a peach skin-like flavor.”,pFriem Mango Pale Ale,/review/mango-pale-ale
"The peach tastes as much like it is baked as it is fresh. This plays well off of the honey and lightly toasted malt notes. It’s light bodied, with medium carbonation and well-balanced. Finishes dry with lingering peach and a touch of bitterness and acidity.",Lone Tree Peach Pale,/review/peach-pale
"Very balanced. Pine hops give a Christmas tree welcome. Citrus hops flavor tends toward grapefruit. The bready malt helps you relax, and the bitterness is restrained. A touch heavier body than other examples with a moderate carbonation level. Finishes with bitterness and a light hops spiciness.",Karbach Weekend Warrior,/review/weekend-warrior
"Soft, subtle light fruit from the malt (pineapple, candy sugar) pairs nicely with the rich hops character that displays pine, grass, strawberry, and hints of citrus and/or lemon balm. The bitterness is very restrained, but it works well in this case. Moderate carbonation helps keep the bitterness on top of the malt sweetness.",Against the Grain A Beer,/review/a-beer
"Orange, grapefruit, pine, touch of lemon, and strawberry. Caramel sweetness with a lingering toasted bread character. Balance is slightly sweet from all of the perceived esters, but the bitterness supports things well and finishes clean. Has just enough English pale-ale character to remind you where American pale ales came from.",Sun King Osiris Pale Ale,/review/osiris-pale-ale
"Lemon dominates and is supported by peach and lemongrass. There’s a creamy character, like a meringue. Malt plays second fiddle, and the ferment was clean aside from some esters kicked by the yeast typical of style. The sweet finish emphasizes fruity elements of hops.",Lord Hobo Glorious,/review/glorious
"Fruit-forward pale ale with cantaloupe and orange notes. Bitterness is nicely restrained and lingers for a while. Slightly astringent and grassy, but not to the point of being distracting. Malt is clean beneath and adds complexity to the perceived sweetness from the fruity hops. Well-placed fermentation esters highlight the fruit notes of the hops.",Bootstrap Stick's Pale Ale,/review/sticks-pale-ale
"Fairly light body, and a moderate carbonation gives it a nice bite mixed with the crisp and clean hops bitterness at the end of the sip. Finishes with moderate bitterness—pine mostly—and a touch of supporting sweetness. There’s less fruit flavor than promised by the aroma, but it’s very clean and balanced with a dry, refreshing finish.",Bale Breaker Field 41 Pale Ale,/review/field-41-pale-ale

"Unusual perceived sweetness up front is quite fruity (could be the hops). Crisp and clean with a light body and moderate carbonation. Mild fruitiness (lemon, strawberry, and light grapefruit). Bitterness plays a supporting role with hops flavor up front and malt sweetness in the background. The finish is crisp and dry, with a pleasant lingering bitterness.",Societe The Statesman,/review/the-statesman
"Well-balanced malt sweetness and hops bitterness. Bready malt notes. Hops are citrus and berry in nature with some fun lingering esters. Finishes fairly dry, given the caramelized malts.",Four Peaks Pitchfork Pale Ale,/review/pitchfork-pale-ale
"Lots of hops flavor but rather low on bitterness. There’s a bright fruitiness in the beginning with a light earthy characteristic. Medium bitterness balances out the fruit with mild carbonation. Light bready malt provides sweetness mid-palate but drops out for a drier, mild finish that has an interesting hops character with hints of tobacco and resin.",Starr Hill Grateful Pale Ale,/review/grateful-pale-ale
"Light caramel malt with hints of toast. Nice grassy, lemon hops character balances nicely. Finish is relatively dry, well-balanced, with lingering bitterness and fruity hops character.",Ninkasi Pacific Rain Northwest Pale,/review/pacific-rain-northwest-pale
Malt is about as simple as it can get—likely using some Pilsner malt to brighten things up beyond just plain 2-row pale malt. Hops are fruity (peach) and floral with just a touch of pine. Underlying spice notes add complexity. Finishes clean with a smooth lingering bitterness.,Lagunitas Sumpin' Easy Ale,/review/sumpin-easy-ale
"Bright hops character throughout—lots of lemon and pine with a touch of grass. The underlying beer is clean, has a nice caramel malt backbone, and supports the hops. The finish has really nice clean pine notes with a grassy dry hops profile.",Heavy Seas AmeriCannon,/review/americannon
"Light lactic sourness with a pleasant hop bitterness. Floral and lime play well off of the tartness, but that runs all over the sweetness of the malt. There’s a salty character and a light lemon and ripe-apple fruitiness. It finishes dry.",Urban Artifact Finn,/review/finn
"Clean malt bill with lingering fruity bitterness. Same floral and lemon and blueberry as in the aroma. Bitterness grows in the aftertaste and lingers around. The fruitiness subsides and is left with a bitter, dank hop profile. Light sweetness remains in the background. Nicely balanced.",Upslope Citra Pale Ale,/review/citra-pale-ale
"Herbal and spicy hops with a slight hint of citrus up front with a light sweetness. Bitterness quickly steps in. Finish reveals a touch of sweet malt, which softens the brunt of the bitterness. A medium carbonation and light body keep it crisp.",Station 26 Pale Ale,/review/pale-ale
"Bright, juicy hops notes with predominantly orange but also some lemon zest, grapefruit pith, and pine. A light malt sweetness up front adds to the fruity impression from the hops. Chewy mouthfeel with a slightly drying effect on the finish. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness.",Commonhouse aleworks Park Circle Pale,/review/park-circle-pale
"Slightly malt-forward with toast, caramel, and a touch of chocolate above a clean base-malt character. Bitterness balances this beer very well, and the hops flavor is of orange, apricot, and pine. One of the more complex malt bills we’ve had tonight.",Alaskan Big Mountain Pale Ale,/review/big-mountain-pale-ale
"Caramel and simple malt sweetness up front with a touch of clean bitterness. Fruity throughout with peach, cherry, orange, lime, and medium-light pine. Slight mineral character on the swallow.

The clean malt bill that brings a touch of toasted character blends well with the fleshy peach character. Hops are citrus in nature and blend well with the rest of the beer. Finishes a little sweet.,Braxton Moving to the Country,/review/moving-to-the-country
"Light body with a touch of wheat malt-like sweetness. Hops bring lemon and peach with a slightly grassy note. Bitterness is low-medium and lingers. Then comes a hoppy pineapple character with some dank undertones with an earthy mushroom-like flavor. Thin body with a lack of chewiness that the style is known for. Toward the end of the sip there’s a light green coffee spiciness. Finish tends toward sweet, which accents the high fruit hop contribution.",Prison City 4 Piece Pale Ale Simcoe,/review/4-piece-pale-ale-simcoe
"Moderate lactic acidity is well-balanced by the toasted malt character. Very light tartness on the finish. Cherry and lemon esters, possibly from the hops, add a light bitterness and a slightly astringent finish that likely comes from malt tannin. A creamy lactic sourness checks the touch of sweetness in the body. Most will find this funky and tart, trending toward wild ale territory.",Deep Ellum Brett Pale ale,/review/brett-pale-ale
"Hops are predominantly fruity with some floral supporting characteristics. Big hops bitterness, but good balance for the style with a relatively dry finish. Malt is clean with a touch of toast and light caramel. The residual caramel sweetness is backed by a resinous bitterness that lets the hops character linger.",Boise Brewing Syringa Pale,/review/syringa-pale
"Great light toasted malt sweetness. The hops are lemony and slightly grassy as noted in the aroma and bring a smooth bitterness. The finish is pretty aggressive, bordering on harsh, for such a light beer, but it grows on you over time. Lemon, mint, and pine linger on a dry finish.",4 Noses Proboscis Simcoe,/review/proboscis-simcoe
"Simple malt bill is balanced very well with the bitterness level. Hops on taste buds match those on aroma.

"Chewy and hazy with rich, bright tropical-fruit notes. Starts out a little on the sweet side. Bitterness is well moderated for the style.

Finish has a nice puckering tart quality that accentuates the fruit notes well.",Mikerphone Mikerphone Drop,/review/mikerphone-drop

"The flavor follows up on everything the aroma suggested—rich, sweet, chocolate coffee but adds in a hoppy bitterness that supports the roasty edge. While the bitterness lingers into finish with a light acidity, it’s still fairly smooth. Just enough alcohol to feel appropriate for the style.",Fremont Brewing Dark Star,/review/dark-star
"Low malt complexity but a wonderful tartness that lingers from start to fnish. Big carbonation helps bright up fruit flavors. Finish is extremely dry and refreshing. Moderately strong cherry, blackberry, and blueberry. Light acidity gives it a crisp refreshing finish and the earthy notes gives it some interesting complexity.",Smuttlabs Kisses & Kittens,/review/kisses--kittens

"Pretty sweet overall. Lots of chocolate and caramel. Some dry toastiness on the finish, with maybe a bit of soy sauce. Bitterness comes primarily from the roast. The coffee additions are really well done and accentuate the roast character and add some subtle underlying fruitiness.",Crooked Stave Coffee Baltic Porter,/review/coffee-baltic-porter

"Lemon flavors abound, with hints of lemon zest and lemon juice. When combined with tartness, it comes across as lemon drop or Warheads candies. Tartness is somewhat sharp and a bit lingering in the finish. Somewhat balanced (not too dry or too sweet), but tartness helps give a perception of dryness in the finish. Moderate sour lemon note up front with the sourness that grows throughout the sip to the end.",Libertine Brewing Company Saison,/review/saison-libertine

"There’s a nice carbonation up front that really enhances the flavor and character of this beer. Acidic tartness hits first with notes of lemon and is followed by a blend of woody earthiness and dry red-grape notes. The grape character adds sweetness with a light bread malt base. It’s quite sour, but the finish is dry with a nice tannic bitterness that cuts the acidity a bit.",Jester King 2016 Spon Mourvedre & Sangiovese,/review/2016-spon-mourvedre-and-sangiovese
"Grapes! Root Beer! Cherry Jolly Ranchers! There is a lot going on in this beer. Malt forward and sweet but not too sweet. Sweet notes of caramel, toast, and honey.

Enjoyed the carbonation, and there is a dryness that helps to cut some of the sweetness.",Sun King Brewery Magpie Muckle,/review/magpie-muckle

"Sweet and dry at the same time. Sweetness hits up front with red grape and cherry-like qualities. Fruit notes of raspberry and prune. A little lemon adds complexity and a slight tartness. Very interesting transition on the swallow—up front it’s light, with an apple-like fruit character, which changes to a deeper finish with hints of cherry and dark malt. The sourness complements throughout, the finish is dry and lingering with a nice tannic/wood character.”",Sun King Brewery Jimmy Jam,/review/jimmy-jam
"This shows signs of great aging with sherry and dates coming on strong and complemented by wet black malt, roast, earthy hops, medium bitterness, lots of alcohol, and finishing with a dessert-wine sweetness that stops just short of cloying. Throughout, there’s rich layers of chocolate, plums, dates, dried cherry, and other assorted fruits.",LIC Beer Project Barley Wine,/review/barley-wine
"Really mellow layers of raisin and fruity character that actually work really well together. Alcohol astringency is mildly distracting, but is rounded by deep vanilla.

"Caramel and vanilla dominate the palate. Toast, red apple, cherry, pear, and a light tannic dryness are also present in lower levels. Balance of the base beer is spot on, and it finishes dry. The oak tannins and vanilla work well to accent all of the other flavors while the hops are just enough to center the beer.",Silver City Brewery Fat Woody,/review/fat-woody

"Carbonation is high, which enhances the flavor in this beer. Grape character is of white wine and a bit dry, which fits well with the overall saison structure. A mild earthiness with slight spice is not overpowering, and a bit of lemon sweetness is complemented by a cider character.”",Funkwerks Nelson Sauvin,/review/nelson-sauvin
"Oak and wood is strong through the flavor. The bourbon sits in the back. Some smoke. Dark fruits—dried cherries, figs, plums. Light in the body for a wee heavy, but stilll captures the expected malt flavors. Some burnt sugar and caramel malt, with a distinctive dry woodsy finish.”",Sprecher Commando,/review/commando
"Huge hops flavor (grassy, citrus), moderate bitterness. Yes, there’s a fair amount of bready/crackery malt in the mix, but this is a hops party. Slightly sweet start with nice citrus flavors. Medium body with the hops bitterness helps to create a dry finish. Lively carbonation combined with fresh hops flavors is refreshingly zippy.",MadTree Brewing Happy Amber,/review/happy-amber

The hops come through more in the flavor with pine, grassy, slightly earthy, and grapefruit pith character.",Civil Life American Brown Ale,/review/american-brown-ale
"Red berry, grape, and cola. Caramel and toast. It’s a big blend of crystal malt and West Coast hops.

Creamy and effervescent with moderate bitterness and a dry finish.",AleSmith Brewing Wee Heavy,/review/wee-heavy

Pleasant aftertaste of lemon, light bready malt, and light woody notes.",Rowley Farmhouse ales If You Must,/review/if-you-must
Very similar to the nose—malt and tobacco rolled together with caramel and toffee toast. The oxidation tastes more like old malt. A mild hops flavor that builds into a slightly resinous and woody combination with a medium finish.,Montauk Arrowhead Red Ale,/review/arrowhead-red-ale
"Same as the aroma. The beer is moderately sweet and the malt is very complex. Not very fruity, maybe a subtle red apple or plum quality. The mustiness from the nose is not nearly as noticeable. Hops are far in the background, leaving the malt to shine. Velvety smooth finish.”",High Water Brewing Tranquil Eyes,/review/tranquil-eyes
"Resinous and citrusy hops (with some strawberry and peach notes) are still dominant, but they are balanced nicely with some nice sweet malt notes. Some toast and roast. Moderately low sweetness and moderately high bitterness. Dry finish. The malt bill definitely plays a supporting role to the hops in this one. The hops flavors morph between fresh pine and East Denver grow-house dankness, but given the touch of toasted character, both work well.",Hidden Cove Bucko's Hoppy Brown Ale,/review/buckos-hoppy-brown-ale
"Lots of concord grape with caramel and toast create a deep malt sweetness, with rich caramel and burnt sugar. Yeast esters are a bit restrained compared to the aroma, but give a red caramel apple note. The malt sweetness is balanced slightly by hops and remains surprisingly dry.”",Traquair Jacobite Ale,/review/jacobite-ale
"Complex caramel and toast blend throughout with some dark stone-fruit esters lingering beneath, cherry and plum. Finish is pretty dry in part due to the higher carb, but there’s also some lingering bitterness to help balance out the malt sweetness. Where the aroma was a touch too estery, the flavor is in perfect balance with the malt complementing the fruity notes and the fruity notes enhancing the malt.”",Traquair House Ale,/review/house-ale
"Smooth earthy hops flavor (spruce, pine) entwined with a pleasant vein of subtly roasty maltiness. Nice balance—flavor progresses from lightly sweet malt through hops bitterness to a dry finish that brings back just enough of the bitterness to give you something to think about before the next sip.",Left Hand Brewing Sawtooth Ale,/review/sawtooth-ale
"Toasted caramel malt, with dried nutty notes and a hint of dates, too, but in a mild way.

It all works relatively well.",High Water Brewing Old And In The Way,/review/old-and-in-the-way
"Rich caramel and bread crust malt. Well-placed hops bitterness with some alcohol warmth that cuts the sweetness. Wonderfully balanced, strong flavors complement rather than compete.

Still feels slightly restrained—the barrel, chocolate, and fruit characters could be amplified a bit.",Firestone Walker Sucaba 2016,/review/sucaba-2016
"Lots more hazelnut, caramel, toffee, some vanilla, and oak coming through. Fairly sweet with some alcohol and oak to balance.

Light chocolate in the background.",Dry Dock Double Hazelnut Brown (2014),/review/double-hazelnut-brown-2014
"Malt forward. The honey sweetness hits up front and carries through. Behind this sweetness is bread, caramel, some white grape. The oak character adds some earthiness and wood notes, which work well with the flavor. Sweet but not too sweet, full of flavors like toffee and a bit of herbs. Warming on the finish.",Cambridge Brewing Arquebus,/review/arquebus
"The good news—this is a light, flavorful, balanced beer with notes of toasted bread and earthy hops, lively carbonation, and a nice lingering biscuit malt flavor. It’s heavier on the malt side, but the dry finish ensures that it’s not too sweet or heavy. The bad news is that it is somewhat grainy. The astingency is mild, but despite looking crystal clear (pun intended), my mouth feels like I should pick out some husk.",Wasatch Brewery Evolution Amber Ale,/review/evolution-amber-ale
The barrel gives some vanilla and cinnamon spice. Really nice balance of flavors. Big toffee notes with some oak earthiness.

Alcohol warmth is there and lingers.",Against the Grain London Balling,/review/london-balling
"Subtle malt complexity comes through with toasty and caramel notes that meld with the malt to produce a feeling of chocolate liqueur. Esters contribute notes of stewed apple, plum, and fig, while a bit of vanilla chimes in from the barrel.

Fairly low bitterness.",Wiley Roots Double Barrel Barleywine,/review/double-barrel-barleywine

"Moderate malt with mostly toast and a bit of toffee. Esters bring out a cola character along with burnt sugar, bready malt, fresh pear, and low earthy and spicy hops.

"A spicy and resinous hop flavor forms the backbone of the beer and is accented by dark crystal malt, toffee, toast, unsweetened baker’s chocolate, dark fruits like dates and plums.

"Soy sauce, bourbon, chocolate, alcohol, oak, raisin, and dark fruit are all apparent in this full-bodied beer dominated by sweetness and cut by copious amounts of ethanol.

"Rich malt with caramel, toasted coconut, and toffee comes out more in the flavor. Vanilla from the barrel sits behind the malt. Fairly sweet but not over the top.

As it warms the sweetness comes out as well as the honey.",Cambridge Brewing Co. Blunderbuss,/review/blunderbuss
"Well blended. There is a really fun balance between some nice sweetness, some earthiness, a little funk, and a light tartness. The fruit character of grapes, a little cherry, some strawberry, also has notes of peanuts, wine cork, oak ,and vanilla. Quite acidic overall with a sticky mouthfeel, but finishes great without the punishing dryness of over-attenuation.”",Black Project Supercruise Cab Sauv,/review/supercruise-cab-sauv
"The flavor of this beer dances between roast character with some malt sweetness and fruit sweetness. The roast is a bit of coffee, leather, and chocolate.

Light Pilsner and floral flavor up front with a very delicate body. Bitterness toward the end of the sip that lingers after the sip.,Suarez Family Brewery Qualify Pils,/review/qualify-pils
"Limeade-like citric acid tag teams with a lactic acid tang for an unstoppable duo. Slight lactose sweetness in the middle of the sip dries out in the finish. Rich fruity sweetness up front, with a sour punch in the middle and a nice spice astringency on the swallow to clean things up.",Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project Key Lime Tau,/review/key-lime-tau
"Syrupy sweet toasted coconut floating in hot chocolate. The alcohol balances the sweet, but it’s right at the edge of cloying (if not over). The aftertaste lets more of the roast shine through. A bit of a barrel note on the swallow. It’s gloriously and unapologetically unbalanced in the best of ways.",Three Taverns German Chocolate Helm's Deep,/review/german-chocolate-helms-deep
"Drier than expected from the aroma, that brings out the subtle character in the fruit. Finish is a bit astringent, but softened by the mellow sourness. The spice character adds some nice complexity but isn’t overdone, which lets the fruit character dominate.",Central 28 Currantly Blue,/review/currantly-blue
"Rich and complex dark malt flavors—chocolate, raisins, roast with a soft mellow mouthfeel. The finish has a lot of roast bitterness and astringency, but I’m not finding it off-putting, it lets the dark malt complexity and sweetness linger and cuts the alcoholic heat a bit.",High Water Campfire Stout,/review/campfire-stout
"Sort of like an oaked malty IPA—citrusy hops, oak, balanced bourbon, and subtle pecan nuttiness. Well balanced flavors, alcohol very apparent.",High Water Sugaree,/review/sugaree
"The molasses and the unique malt sweetness dominate, but are coupled with this dark umami richness that approaches soy sauce, but still stays a healthy distance from that fate. The bourbon barrel contributes to the heat, but  also rounds all the flavors together while adding a nice toasted almond and vanilla note that helps compliment the molassess.",High Water BA Campfire Stout,/review/ba-campfire-stout

"The chocolate and caramel are pleasant, while the salt is just perceptable enough to add some jangle. A rounded caramel sweetness backed by chocolate, the finish has some spicy cinnamon and pepper notes that keep it from being cloying. Definitely balanced towards the sweet side, has a lingering alcoholic warmth.”",Burial and J. Wakefield The Cosmic and Divine,/review/the-cosmic-and-divine
"The coffee is really subdued. Mocha with a half shot of vanilla syrup. Big malt, with caramel sweetness and toasty notes. There’s hints of raisin, too. Roast acidity (barely) keeps it from being cloying. The finish is quite boozy, paired with the semisweet finish it comes across a bit heavy.",Central 28 !Idea!,/review/idea
"Rich and rounded flavor profile that showcases the guava esters and how they play off of the richness brought by the lactose and vanilla. Some definite alcoholic heat on the back of the throat on every sip. We were surprised on the palate, as on the aroma, that the corn from the cream ale style shines through just a touch. Nice to taste the base beer in something like this.",The Bruery Guava Libre,/review/guava-libre

Cherries and cranberries are present. Nice juicy character. The sweet sourness of this beer is really nice. The acidic tartness helps to finish the beer out. Some background malt character.

Linger is a slight dry cherry note that is medium lasting.,Cascade Brewing Kriek Ale,/review/kriek-ale

"White grapes on the vine, with notes of citrus, cherry, red berry, pineapple, and tropical fruit—the fruit blends with the beer in the flavor. It’s not until the swallow that the grapes kick in during the retronasal. Not much sweetness, but a high, sharp, clean acidity. Lactic with a touch of acetic, with makes the taste buds tingle—it’s relatively soft, but lingering. Oak and vanilla, dry white wine, and a dry finish.",de Garde Brewing Grand Blanc,/review/grand-blanc
"The wheat malt is like crackers, but with just a touch of bread. It’s creamy, with a bit of grainy astringency, but it’s not off-putting. Spicy hops with some lime and citrus, a tad high for a typical German hefeweizen. The clove is pleasant, with a trace of banana and cherry, low phenols, and a bit of sulfur. A nice, dry finish favors the hops, but not excessively.",Boulder Beer Company Sweaty Betty Blonde,/review/sweaty-betty-blonde
"A wallop of hops fruitiness up front mellows into a nice touch of sweetness, that tapers into an appropriate bitter and juicy finish. Hops flavors incorporate candied oranges, pineapples, over-ripened mangoes, and papayas. Some danky pine notes emerge as it warms, but this only adds depth to an already stellar beer—the orange and tropical fruit notes play off each other and the medium bitterness nicely.",Coronado North Island IIPA,/review/north-island-iipa

"High tangerine and orange note up front with a mild sweetness and medium tartness that lingers into the aftertaste with a heavy fruity note and just a touch of spiciness.

The bright acidity and light pepper note cut through the sweetness of the malt bill.",Brasserie Saint James  Daily Wages,/review/daily-wages
"Rich chocolate flavor up front with a chile flavor in the middle followed by a long chile spice that starts to grow. It never gets very hot, but there’s no missing it. As it warms, a little bit of a honey sweetness tames the heat, and the heat cuts the sweetness. Roast flavors hang out in the background relative to the forward chocolate notes. Coffee and the chocolate with some nice caramel malt underpinning, plus a very light smoke note as well.",Westbrook Brewing Company Mexican Cake,/review/mexican-cake
"Super citrusy and a nice melon, mango-like fruit character with a chewy malt character that isn’t too heavy. Crisp and clean nish with a hint of alcohol heat. Smooth and well-integrated flavors.

Fun mouthfeel. I like the bitterness.",3 Floyds Brewing Company Dreadnaught,/review/dreadnaught
"Hops are aggressively resinous, piney, and citrusy (lemon, oange and grapefruit), but the bitterness stays very steady throughout.

Alcoholic avor is present throughout and strong in the nish.",Great Divide Brewing Company Old Ruffian,/review/old-ruffian
Fresh juicy fruit (lime and lemon) flavors balanced by a nice floral lingering hops bitterness. Spicy phenols of pepper and light clove are notable in the aftertaste. Low level of malt. Pilsner malt backbone finishes dry. The carbonation is spot on but the floral hops are a little strange for the style.,Brasserie de la Senne Jambe De Bois,/review/jambe-de-bois
"Rich and chewy mouthfeel with medium lingering bitterness. Really bright juicy fruit on the front carries through on the back and turns to a nice pine character that lingers into the back of the palate. Malt profile is full-sized, but the bitterness backs it up. Alcohol is well integrated, inspiring!",Melvin Brewing Drunken Master,/review/drunken-master
"Intense lactic sourness in the first sip that’s much more sour than expected but still allows the peach esters to shine through. Slight acetic character dances on top of the peach, and slight Brett funk adds complexity. Notes of peach pie and lemon, with tart wheat malt and sour fermentation. The oak character and the esters are stronger in the sip. The carbonation is perhaps too understated and could have brought out other subtleties.",Casey Brewing and Blending The Cut: Peach (Red Haven),/review/the-cut-peach-red-haven
"Amazing, powerful banana esters, with star fruit, mango, peach, and honeydew to accentuate.

Just a touch of wheat is evident from the base beer.",Fort Collins Brewery Major Tom’s Pomegranate,/review/major-tom-s-pomegranate
"The flavor delivers the same rich coffee effect, with a stronger sense of vanilla and brown sugar. It’s roasty with a touch of acidity, and it’s sweet without being cloying.

The chocolate malt and caramel remind me that this is a beer.",Trillium Brewing PM Dawn,/review/pm-dawn
"Bright, juicy, fresh fruitiness, with moderate grapefruit and mango flavors. Just a hint of fruit sourness in there.

The mouthfeel is pretty thick; the malt adds a little sweetness, yet the finish is somewhat dry.",Bissell Brothers Nothing Gold,/review/nothing-gold
"Lots of grapefruit flavors—tart and citrus, bordering on pith, followed by a light, restrained tartness and a hint of malt sweetness. The resinous hops add to perceived body. The finish is a touch bitter, but balanced, with a hint of astringency. It dries out rather quickly.”",Lagunitas Aunt Sally,/review/aunt-sally

The carbonation helps open up the hops, allowing the flavors to stay on the tongue with a crisp, welcoming feel.",Breakside Brewery Liquid Sunshine Pilsner,/review/liquid-sunshine-pilsner
"Slight malt breadiness that provides a smooth body. Big lemon, tangerine characteristics with a noticeable peppery spice that balances the sweetness and tartness.

Substantial malt structure supports the hops character well.",Hardywood Park Craft Brewery The Great Return,/review/the-great-return
"A very bright orange juice char- acter hits in the front and is very nice. The slightly bready malt sweetness helps to carry the beer through the nish, and it nishes with some caramel, juicy and sweet notes but not too sweet. The alcohol warmth is nice and adds to the beer. Moderately strong hops bitterness, complex malt, and touch of alcohol bite appear in the aftertaste.",Evil Twin Freudian Slip,/review/freudian-slip
"Some caramel, banana, and clove. Sweet malt with a somewhat dry finish. High carbonation with plum and raisin notes. Slight alcohol bite as it goes into the aftertaste. Curious lime-like notes as well create an unexpected but enjoyable fruity bright note.",Brewery Ommegang Abbey Ale,/review/abbey-ale

A very delicate malt character is almost hidden by the fruity/floral character.” ",Ale Industries Golden State of Mind,/review/golden-state-of-mind
"Well balanced and hops-forward, appropriate for style. Malt is simple and clean with a light touch of toast. Bitterness is forward and lingers, inviting the next sip.

"Rich chocolate malts, cinnamon, and vanilla finish. There’s some booze and barrel to balance, but there’s a lot of sweetness.

Very low carbonation is just a notch or two above still.” ",Side Project Derivation 6,/review/derivation-6
"So the aroma, so the flavor. More prominent grapefruit and a touch of pine character. A more pronounced malt character than often seen in this style, with nice bread crust and biscuit notes. There is a nice bitter through-line that keeps everything grounded in the IIPA category. The bitterness is not astringent but heightens some the stronger piney and pithy hop flavors.",The Pike Brewing Co. Doubble Hopulus,/review/doubble-hopulus
"The balance between coffee and roast was nicely done, with notes of roast, cappuccino, caramel, mocha, vanilla, and chocolate. A hint of papery oxidation in there from the roast. Some dark-fruit esters and sherry, which make up some alcohol warmth, and a light touch of piney hops fit in smoothly. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy, and right before the coffee really hits on the finish, a cherry ester pokes out to brighten the overall character of the beer.",Transient Artisan Ales Buckley Light,/review/buckley-light
"Lots of flavor, and the pineapple, orange, mango, and tropical fruits hit with a burst of juiciness. They carry through a creamy body to a nice, refreshing finish.

"A healthy amount of yeast phenolics up front, combined with a dose of fruity esters. Moderately sweet with a bit of tart in the middle but a borderline cloying sweetness carries into the finish. Nice clean dry finish due to the high carbonation. Slight tartness. Touch of orange, lemon, and some spicy notes. A bit bitter in the finish.",Adelbert’s Brewery Philosophizer,/review/philosophizer
"Thick roast coffee syrup poured over graham crackers. Fresh (unlit) tobacco here, too. Great malt complexity with toffee, toast, and chocolate and a big cherry ester. Sweet but not cloying.

There’s a cool spicy phenol that melds well with the alcohol warmth.",Avery Brewing Company Mephistopheles Stout,/review/mephistopheles-stout
"Earthy and piney with a slight honey-like malt sweetness and a well-constructed bitter profile that pushes to the edge of harsh without going over it. Citrus notes are more zesty than fruity. As aggressive as the aroma was, the flavor is quite rounded and approachable. A mild grapefruit-rind note helps it from going too far into the forest",Half Acre Beer Company GoneAway,/review/goneaway
"Big caramel and toffee, moderate banana and citrus, and a touch of grapefruit and plum that lead to an aftertaste of crisp bitterness and moderate sweetness. Flavorful earthy lemony hops with moderate bitterness allow the sweet malt to carry. Alcohol avor is present through the nish and leaves a slight astringency.",Bristol Brewing Old #23,/review/old-23
"Lots of caramel almost bordering on burnt caramel. Great malt sweetness with lots of dark fruit tones: cherry, raisin, prune, dates, and plum.

Extremely restrained bitterness that lets the whirlpool and dry hop shine. Body is solid. Chewy, juicy, rich mouthfeel. Give me the rest of this!",Great Notion Brewing Mandela IPA,/review/mandela-ipa
"Classic Belgian quad with background cherry. Massive dark stone-fruit character floats on top of a traditional quad malt bill. The cherries are well blended with the fermentation esters and phenolics, and the alcohol is present but not hot. The finish is dry with some lingering perceived sweetness, and the high ABV kind of numbs your palate. A bit more carbonation would make everything pop just a touch.",Adroit Theory Brewing Company All I See Is Carrion,/review/all-i-see-is-carrion
"Surprisingly intense passion fruit up front, with a pleasant tartness to balance the sweetness from the fruit and the wheat. Coconut flavors remind me of a Piña colada. The wheat character beneath serves as a secondary but supporting role, and the carbonation heightens the acidity, but also clears off the palate, encouraging more sips.",Avery Brewing Co. Liliko’i  Kepolo,/review/liliko-i-kepolo
"There’s no doubt that coffee is the main focus of this beer—it dominates that palate start to finish. If you’re able to peel away the coffee, there are some nice chocolate and cherry notes, with a heavy roasted malt presence and a bit of soy sauce. Hairy hops presence. Moderate paper and sherry oxidation, creamy body, and some dark fruit esters of dates and raisins. The 14 percent ABV is relatively under control. Well balanced, with the alcohol and sweetness riding out the bitter aftertaste.",Transient Artisan Ales Buckley,/review/buckley

Good carbonation and a delicate body, with great hops complexity and fruit notes that carry through to the finish.",Trillium Summer Street,/review/summer-street
"Surprisingly full body—a little too salty, but blends well with the mineral-water notes. The assertive hops flavor smacks into a pillow of soft sourness, accompanied by pineapple esters and a maltiness that adds a touch of sweetness. Lemon juice and a hint of lime zest play well with the hops notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerine. The finish is dry, which accentuates the tartness a bit.",Grand Teton Brewing Gose,/review/gtgose
"Starts with a biscuit sweetness, as well as some toast and roastiness and honey notes. The assertive hops bitterness is supportive, but doesn’t overpower. Some of the mintiness is still present in the flavor. The lighter carbonation makes this a creamy and smooth lager that refreshes.",Ska Brewing Mexican Logger,/review/mexican-logger
"Light sweetness up front with a touch of pear and lemongrass. Moderate spicy notes that are balanced with the sweetness and carbonation. Aftertaste has slight spicy bitterness and lemongrass notes.

Balance is really wonderful on this beer as the style of the yeast characteristics meld well together.",Tallgrass Brewing Company  Songbird Saison,/review/songbird-saison
"Rich dark chocolate note, to the point of bitter chocolate, with a moderate alcohol note that swoops in to take its place. Moderate coffee is well-integrated and very smooth.

Low-medium vanilla supports everything.",Jackie O’s Pub & Brewery Champion Ground,/review/champion-ground

Big stone fruit and prune flavors dominate up front. Slight <em>Brett</em> funk balances the tartness. Bourbon is very subtle.  Sweetness finishes in the back with some acidity. Slight huskiness on the finish that gives a good counter to the sourness and sweetness. The oak adds complexity with some bourbon notes adding to the taste.

"Hops-forward with pine and citrus dominant, and as it warms, some pineapple notes appear. There is a moderate fruity sweetness up front that’s almost like candy.

"A mix of peach, cherry, and maybe plum add some soft fruit flavor with just enough acidity to keep this from being jammy. Something spicy like nutmeg is added to the mix, coupled with a tartness that doesn’t linger. Low hops add a light tropical-fruit note, with some tannic and hoppy bitterness in the finish. Wheaty malt backbone that balances, with a finish that doesn’t linger.",Deep Ellum Play Date,/review/play-date
"The malt hits up front, with some pear-like juiciness. The citrus flavor has a bit of delicate lemon.

Pleasant hops bitterness with a solid malt back. The finish is clean and not harsh.",Hardywood Park Craft Brewery Quadrahop,/review/quadrahop
Surprisingly light on the tongue. Some honey notes complement the malt sweetness. Hops walk the line to provide a pleasant complementary bitterness to the malts. Wonderful balance of tannins from the oak wine barrel and the toasted malt characters. The warming alcohol is fruity grape and tree fruit (plums and apricots).,Deschutes Brewery Mirror Mirror,/review/mirror-mirror
"Sweet malt (caramel, toffee, and raisins) up front. Very fruity with notes of cherry mixed with a moderate alcohol note. Slight spicy hops note lingers into the aftertaste.

"Rich cinnamon and dark and bittersweet chocolate open up to bourbon, vanilla, and just a hint of coffee and smoke. Barrel character is present throughout, but not overwhelming.

Monday (2016),/review/monday-2016
"The honey flavors are a bit more restrained than the aroma, with the peppery phenol character dominant. Considerable herbal and floral character. The honey notes are present but not overpowering; they add some nice sweetness. Clean and refreshing in the finish.

"Coffee with lots of chocolate, like a milk-chocolate bar.  Cinnamon and chile pepper behind that. Moderately high sweetness with moderate bitterness. Milky, lactose consistency makes the chocolate sweeter and keeps the heat down. A bit boozy. The malt brings a nice richness, and the coffee dries things out.” ",Prairie Artisan Ales Bomb!,/review/bomb
Rich complex roasty character —chocolate and coffee up front—with a huge tobacco kick. The vanilla from the barrel adds richness and rounds things out.

"Fruity with overripe pear and peach. Spicy and slightly smoky phenols. If there’s tea, they added plenty of milk.

The carbonation is moderate.”  ",Great Divide Brewing Co. Nadio Kali Hibiscus Saison,/review/nadio-kali-hibiscus-saison

"The roast malt slides in smoothly and builds to a nice coffee intensity. Creamy flavor and creamy mouthfeel. The underlying sweetness is pleasant but not too powerful until it fades down to let you really get the roasty bitter finish of the coffee flavor. The bitterness lingers along with some acidity, but it’s buoyed by the remaining sweetness. A faint whiff of hops in that initial sip adds some pleasant earthy complexity. Coffee balances the sweetness with a crisp roasted background.",Ninkasi Brewing Company Noir Milk Stout,/review/noir-milk-stout
Bright and juicy hops notes are high on avor and moderate on bitterness. Finish is clean with only a hint of astringency. Malt is lightly sweet and balanced perfectly with the moderate hops bitterness. Slight astringency in the bitterness distracts from the otherwise pleasant finish. The juicy character of the beer carries through to the finish and sits beside the bitter aspects from the hops in this beer.,Against the Grain Brewery Rico Sauvin,/review/rico-sauvin
"Fresh oak is the rst impression, plenty of vanilla notes. The brewer took the beer off the oak before the tannic and harsh notes showed up—nice job!

Barrel character is vanilla and peach like.",Boulder Beer Scourage of the Dude,/review/scourage-of-the-dude
Mid-level malts supply caramel and toffee while the fruit esters (cherry and peach) are subdued.

Linger is moderately lasting and dry with slight peppery notes.",Brasserie Cantillon Kriek,/review/kriek-cantillon
"Rich and chewy up front, moderately bitter and dry in the back. Peach, citrus, pine throughout. The candy-like malt sweetness that helps bring out the fruity hops subsides nicely. Very complex beer.

"The first impression was some barnyard funk, yet this is followed by a subtle quality of pear and apple notes, which come out more in the flavor than the aroma.

Malt is simple with a touch of toasted complexity.",Three Taverns Craft Brewery A Night On Ponce,/review/a-night-on-ponce
"Balanced like an Orange Julius—fruity and sweet throughout, with bitterness to balance, and a bit of tartness mid-palate.

Finishes slightly dry and bitter, with notes of mango and tropical fruit.",Brew Gentlemen Tree Star,/review/tree-star
"Strong notes of spruce and pine come through along with some grapefruit and orange juice character that adds a slight sweetness and some bitterness. Mild lemon sits behind the pine and grapefruit/orange notes, and there are those basil/oregano herbal notes again. Malt contribution is a bit toasty and a touch of caramel. A little light bodied, and the hops dominate through the taste. The finish is bitter but not so bitter as to whack you over the head. Needs more CO2 to open up.",Station 26 Brewing Co.

"Huge berry character that integrates well with a clean IPA base beer. The hops character is fairly restrained, but the bitterness plays well off of the sweetness from the berry esters. There’s lots of spruce, like rubbing a Christmas tree. The finish is fairly bitter and lingers. It’s a bit like putting an entire roll of Life Savers candy in your mouth at once—all of them. The touch of candy sweetness is unexpected, but the bracing pine tree bitterness keeps it from cloying.” ",Alaskan Brewing Co.  Spruce IPA,/review/spruce-ipa

"Piney with orange and blood orange in tow. The malt is simple and leaves a slightly sweet profile which probably brings out the richness of the citrus. The bitterness is about right and lingers pleasantly, although a bit more would help offset the sweetness.",Anderson Valley Brewing Company Ee Tah! IPA,/review/ee-tah-ipa
"Rich, dark caramel-malt sweetness up front with a slight chewy note. Dark-fruit notes of cherry, plum, prune, and raisin, as well as apple and pear. Medium hops spicy note in the middle. A bit sweet, but otherwise the finish is relatively dry. Moderately carbonated. Well-balanced fruit, spice, and body.",Funkwerks Quad,/review/quad
"Pine and lemon are front and center. Orange citrus notes with just a touch of toasted malt support. Significant, but not overwhelming, bitterness with enough malt backbone to make this beer really drinkable. A bit of pine. The keynote is that clean bitterness that offers a long aftertaste, partnered with the pine and some citrus. Well after the swallow, I’m still savoring.",Ballast Point Brewing Company Unfiltered Sculpin,/review/unfiltered-sculpin
Bold tart kick in the front with lemon and acidic tartness. The apricots come through and provide some sweetness but sit behind the lactic character in this beer. High carbonation level helps to finish this beer nicely. Tastes more like cooked apricot (apricot pie maybe) than fresh fruit.,Almanac Beer Co Valley of the Heart’s Delight,/review/valley-of-the-hearts-delight
"Earthy hops flavor (rosemary with a bit of sage) hits first, but then a dollop of tropical/citrus comes in and takes over with rich tropical fruit (especially papaya), tangerine, some grapefruit, and lemon. Between the citrus and the esters, this is very fruity. A moderate sweetness hits up front, and the hops bitterness balances out the sweetness through the taste. Moderate-to-full chewy body.",Breakside Brewery Wanderlust,/review/wanderlust
Fresh cherry juice with some tartness that could be from the fruit itself. Fruity complexity from the cherry and elderberry is well complemented by the malty backbone of the base beer. Hints of raspberry and blackberry and a touch of lemon to make things pop a bit. Finishes relatively dry given the sweet body throughout with some tannins to make you want another sip.,Rodenbach Brewery Fruitage,/review/fruitage
" great hops-forward flavor that’s full of lemon, citrus, tangerine, and pineapple. At the forefront are fruity/floral esters, which are a great complement to the fresh and juicy hops. The wheat lends a breadcrust and caramel character. The thick mid-palate is resinous and coats the tongue, leading into a dry, crisp finish.",Three Floyds Brewing Company Gumballhead,/review/gumballhead
"The flavor is more in line for the style than the aroma with a bigger hops contribution, but it’s still very berry ester–forward for style. The melon is more subdued than in the aroma. Would like some more citrus to add complexity. Bitterness is centered for the style. Spicy/pine hops flavor. Light malt sweetness. Fairly dry.",Brooklyn Brewery Defender IPA,/review/defender-ipa
"Huge bourbon up front, followed by strong malt sweetness of caramel, molasses, and heavy chocolate. A touch of maple syrup, coffee, spice, vanilla, and light oak tannins as well, with some heavy dark fruits of plum, cherry, and raisin. The whiskey alcohol warming is pleasant, with just a touch of alcohol burn, and a light licorice sweetness.",Perennial Artisan Ales Maman 2016,/review/maman-2016
"Well balanced with a lightly toasted malt bill supporting citrus and tropical fruit and a touch of light stone fruit. Finishes a bit sweet, but the medium-high lingering bitterness helps to cut through the sweetness. Moderate alcohol warmth.”",Cigar City Brewing Space Pope IPA,/review/space-pope-ipa
"Grapefruit, orange peel, and citrus hops flavors with a subtle amount of dank hops. Juicy hops dominate with just enough sweet malt to balance. The fruity hops punch becomes more complex the longer it sits on the tongue. Lighter body than expected but the body grew as it warmed. Finishes with a moderate bitterness of dank hops, and the dryness makes for a crushable beer.","Great Notion Juice, Jr.",/review/juice-jr
"Orange and tangerine dominate the palate with notes of grapefruit, some lemon, and a little tropical fruit (mango and pineapple). The hops come through from the start to the finish of the sip. Nice balancing malt. Some nice bitterness in the finish helps cut the sweetness. Balance is pushing IIPA, but in a massively drinkable way.",Comrade Brewing Superpower IPA,/review/superpower-ipa
"Moderate sour with big blueberry muffin sweetness that’s kept in check by the acidity and carbonation. The base beer is simple, with a clean primary (not kettle) fermentation that’s clean and neutral. The bready sweetness carries the assertive blueberry flavor, and the tartness comes through more in the finish.",Great Notion Blueberry Muffin,/review/blueberry-muffin
"The cracker-like malt is sweet, with notes of salt, biscuit, and Pilsner malt. Floral hops are present but aren’t too bitter, and further notes of spice, melon, and lime linger through the aftertaste. Clean and refreshing, what it lacks in complexity it gains in simple refreshment.",Summit Brewing Company Bohemian-Style Pilsener,/review/bohemian-style-pilsener
"Slightly balanced on the side of malt for the style, but with enough bitterness to carry the sweetness. Hops are citrus and floral with hints of lemon, orange, lemongrass, passion fruit, and a touch of dank. A toasty bread backbone. Finish is slightly grassy and has just enough bitterness.",Coronado Brewing Company Islander IPA,/review/islander-ipa
"Heavy peach up front, as if I bit into a ripe one in the middle of August. The saison flavors emerge as the peach fades, with a noticeable peppery character and pleasant lemony ester. The peach comes back in the aftertaste, but is just subtle enough to encourage another sip. Perhaps a little sweet or heavy on the body for a saison, but overall tasty.",Avery Brewing Co. Perzik Saison,/review/perzik-saison
"The hops character is citrus-forward (lemon, orange, a bit of grapefruit) with a touch of light stone fruit in the background and a little mint. The hops come in with a fruity sweetness that carries through the taste. Sweetness and bitterness balance, but the finish is slightly sweet.",Eddyline Brewery Crank Yanker,/review/crank-yanker
"The roastiness in this beer is really nice and the chocolate comes in with a nice smoothness. Nice coffee flavor. Sweet cherry notes hit through the flavor. There is a vanilla sweetness that hits and carries through the finish. The oaky, fruity barrel character plays well with the rich chocolate malt notes from the base beer. A hint of alcohol doesn’t overwhelm. A pleasant amount of roast bridges the gap between the barrel and the sweetness in the beer.","FiftyFifty Brewing Co. Eclipse Grand Cru
",/review/eclipse-grand-cru
"Big earthy bitterness, lightly chalky, resinous but not sharp. Surprisingly low bitterness for the obviously large amount of hops in the beer. Lovely caramel malt sweetness helps round out the finish and offset a tiny bit of astringency. Moderate creamy aftertaste. Lovely! Big juicy oranges and passion fruit. Residual sweetness is welcome and lends balance to the pleasantly bitter finish.",Lawson's Finest Liquids Sip of Sunshine,/review/sip-of-sunshine
"Wheat sweetness. Some vanilla and slight coconut. Oak and wood character are present throughout. Honey and fruity with alcohol warmth in the finish. Moderate tannin bitterness. The barrel carries through, but the wheatwine is still present and contributes a welcomed sweetness to balance some of the barrel tannins and stronger alcohol flavors.",Bottle Logic Brewing Ideation,/review/ideation
"Clean, hoppy, fairly bitter. Fruity notes of lemon and grapefruit, strawberry, and tropical fruit dominate the palate with some nice piney complexity in the background. Malt bready sweetness, like Belgian waffles. Some grassy earthiness adds complexity. The hops are showcased and are carried with some assertive bitterness that hits, carries through the finished taste, and lingers.",Grand Teton Brewing Company Teton Range  IPA,/review/teton-range-ipa
"We are in the wit zone! Solid blend of coriander and orange, with some good spicy phenols and a pleasantly dry finish. The orange also moderates the malty sweetness. Very similar taste to the aroma: citrus, bananas, cloves, black pepper, and even a touch of pineapple. High carbonation helps to provide a cleansing finish. Alcohol presence is fruity, but otherwise well hidden. Spicy hops flavor is subtle.",Unibroue La Fin Du Monde,/review/la-fin-du-monde
Well balanced with significant fruit character from the hops. Citrus and red berry with a touch of mango and grassy/herbal to top things off. The malt is clean and supporting as it brings a slight toasted bready character. Bitterness lingers with a touch of coating sweetness.,Green Bench Brewing Co. India Pale Ale,/review/green-bench-india-pale-ale
"Dark chocolate and roast notes from the malt mingle with the sweetness from the caramel malts. Malt profile is well supported by spices, mostly cinnamon and some nutmeg. Some pumpkin character but mild. Mostly balanced in flavor and finish, with just a slight edge toward sweetness, especially as it warms.",Redhook Ale Brewery Out of Your Gourd Pumpkin Porter,/review/out-of-your-gourd-pumpkin-porter
"Big peach, moderate apricot, citrus notes of lemon, orange, pink grapefruit, and pineapple. Moderately high acidity, slight lemon-zest bitterness, and a long tail of peach. High carbonation gives it a champagne-like character. Acidity and tartness struggle a bit to compete with some of the subtle citrus and pineapple fruit notes. Finish is rather dry.",Brouwerij Oud Beersel Oude Gueuze Vieille,/review/oude-gueuze-vieille
"Moderately sour up front with an even blend of deep cherry and raspberry flavors. The high acidity mellows out into the finish. As it warms, it becomes fruiter and the cherry and raspberry blend more. The earthy funk adds complexity with some wood-like and hay-like notes. The body is just right to carry these flavors through. Finishes with a blend of the fruit notes and funk complexity.",Jester King Brewery SPON: Raspberry and Cherry,/review/spon-raspberry-and-cherry
Well balanced West Coast  IPA with a simple grain bill that brings a touch of toasted sweetness to balance the intense citrus hops character. Finishes fairly bitter with a slightly sweet kiss.,Iron Springs Pub & Brewery JC Flyer India Pale Ale,/review/jc-flyer-india-pale-ale
"Noticeable banana and wheat flavors up front, with subtle clove spiciness. It’s missing some of the breadiness typical of the style and has more phenol in front and ester in the back, with a light touch of yeast bite. Tart wheat character. The delightful banana fruitiness sits on the tongue after the spicy hops finish.",Two Roads Brewing No Limits Hefeweizen,/review/no-limits-hefeweizen
Well-balanced pine-forward IPA with some light lemon character and light toasted and bready malt notes supporting. Medium body with a balanced bitter finish that has some fruity notes.,Knee Deep Brewing Company Breaking Bud,/review/breaking-bud
"Very mole. The cinnamon is big, with lighter cocoa, paired with caramel and chocolate malt. Rich, complex spicy blend of the standard Mexican chocolate players. Moderately strong alcohol contributes complementary spicy notes and warmth—it’s definitely a sipper. Some sweet dark fruits, possibly plums and dates. The carbonation makes the spice pop just enough without being harsh, and the dryness from the roast makes you want another sip.",Perennial Artisan Ales Abraxas 2016,/review/abraxas-2016
"Restrained juicy sweetness with orange and light grapefruit, with some Tutti-Frutti flavor. It’s juicy, and showcases an array of complex fruits with some pine and spice. Medium hops bitterness that supports the malt sweetness. Moderate body with medium carbonation, and a light, warming alcohol. Lemony aftertaste.",WeldWerks Remember a Day (Extra Juicy Bits),/review/remember-a-day-extra-juicy-bits
The tartness up front is bold with some nice big white grape acidity and lemon-like tartness—nice balance of the acidity and fruity notes of tropical fruits and mango. Very little carbonation—a bit could help the balance. The beer finishes clean and refreshing through the taste.,Evil Twin Nomader Weisse,/review/nomader-weisse
"A bold flavor up front for a Pilsner, with sweet cracker and biscuit, but is quickly followed by some floral spice notes that carry the bitterness through the finish. Noticeable sulfur notes give way to the pine and spice of the hops, as well as some pepper. The malt characters are only in the foundation, providing the body, but don’t truly emerge until the bitterness fades into the aftertaste.",Heater Allen Pils,/review/pils-heater-allen
"Moderate nutty malt, a touch of plum, raisin, light date, with some light sherry oxidation. Finishes dry despite the massive malt aroma with a hint of toasty caramel. The depth and richness of the malt are hard to overstate and range from light biscuit to medium caramel to rich toast. Moderate sweetness is enhanced by the wonderful, yet restrained yeast esters.",Two Brothers Artisan Brewing Domaine Dupage French Country Ale,/review/domaine-dupage-french-country-ale
"Tangerine carries through into the flavor especially well. Lemon, orange, dank, and herbal all work their way in. There’s some alcohol evident as well. Moderate malt sweetness with some caramel and moderately high bitterness.",Melvin Brewing IPA,/review/melvin-ipa
"Big chocolate milkshake with a shot of espresso. Roasted chestnuts straight from a drum cooker, burnt cinnamon roll, old-school earthy American hops, and a very present amount of yeast. Once your palate adapts to the bitterness, the big stout flavors are more noticeable: caramel and chocolate malt, the espresso edge, and the nice sweetness.",Speakeasy Ales & Lagers Scarface,/review/scarface
"Tons of delicious pineapple juice flavor! A silky malt body puts the hops flavor up on a pedestal but remains unobtrusive and simply supportive. This is a powerfully fruity and delightfully delicious beer, regardless of category—the smoothness and fluffiness of this beer is excellent with lemon, pineapple, and mango fruit sweetness. A soft bitterness backs up the copius fruit flavors.",Grimm Artisanal Ales Tesseract,/review/tesseract
"The hops profile showcases lemon, some melon, pineapple, and a bit of pine and onion. Body is slightly light. Some nice balanced sweetness to bitterness.",New Belgium Brewing Company Voodoo  Ranger IPA,/review/voodoo-ranger-ipa

Alcohol warmth is present and carries through in the finish along with some peppery notes.",Stone Brewing Old Guardian Barley Wine,/review/old-guardian-barley-wine
"Fruit-forward with the usual suspects (mango, lemon, pine) and a few odd players: the stone-fruit esters are bright, but odd. Balance is good with the esters providing a touch of sweetness mid-palate that fades beneath the dry finish and lingering bitterness. Overall a little heavy, especially given the lighter color and focus on fruitier hops qualities.",Ninkasi Brewing Company Maiden the Shade,/review/maiden-the-shade
"Rich caramel malt coupled with moderately strong peppery spice, generally fruity, but hard to identify the esters. Alcohol is big and warming. Nice dry finish. The barnyard continues, and the subtle goatiness is complemented by a lovely caramel malt backbone with some herbal, spicy hops flavors. Ginger adds interest. The finish is balanced and invites another sip.",Schlafly / The Saint Louis Brewery Tripel,/review/tripel-schlafly
"There is a nice balance in this beer. Citrus sweetness with notes of grapefruit, lemon, some orange. A delicate sweetness continues throughout the taste. The bitterness adds complexity and carries through the finish but is not overpowering. Light body for the style, but very drinkable.",pFriem Family Brewers Blonde IPA,/review/blonde-ipa
"Moderate bitterness, with light pine notes that extend well into the finish. Light dank and earthy notes, with a little pine and hops freshness. The flavors are delicate, with notes of pineapple, lemon, and tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, with gorgeous carbonation.",Maine Beer Company Another One,/review/another-one
"Light bodied and highly carbonated, which really make the spices pop. The initial subtle note of sweet brown sugar is quickly overtaken by myriad spices, the strongest being cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. It’s very tasty but out of balance with the mild malt backbone. Surprisingly, spices aren’t so overdone to carry over too strongly in the finish, with a bit of sweetness lingering in the light alcoholic finish.",Elysian Brewing Company Great Pumpkin Ale,/review/great-pumpkin-ale
"White wine grape and sharp lemony sourness. Slight vanilla note and touch of coconut sweetness extends into the linger. Malt character is outrageously complex and well-balanced. The fruit is very subdued with notes of passion fruit. High sour notes create a bite and puckering. After it warms, there is a plum and soy sauce–like notes.",DeStihl Brewery St. Dekkera Reserve: Pomme,/review/st.-dekkera-reserve-pomme
"Great balance for a single IPA with a nice sweetness up front, but just bitter enough for a West Coast IPA. Body is light and refreshing with plenty of hops to back things up. Same hops flavors as in the aroma with a touch of toasted malt complexity mid-palate that is quite refreshing.",Rahr & Sons Brewing Company Dadgum IPA,/review/dadgum-ipa
"Bright, light, and crisp, with a dry hops bitterness and light fruitiness. The citrus hops flavors pop up front, with light lemon, grapefruit, and orange. Majorly juicy, like hops candy. Mild malt sweetness quickly drops off to a nice backend bitterness—it’s very clean and showcases the hops well. The body approaches thin, but that’s understandable at this ABV.",Bissell Brothers Baby Genius,/review/baby-genius
"Starts with a rich, bready wheat and a touch of sweetness that gives way to a blend of citrus and peppery phenols. Incredibly fruity, with watermelon, bubblegum, cherry, and orange, balancing superbly with the spicy, peppery phenols and coriander. The soft body and the carbonation perfectly heighten the flavors. The dry finish makes you want another sip.”",Oskar Blues Brewery Priscilla Wit,/review/priscilla-wit

"A great fruit complexity, featuring orange, pineapple, grapefruit, citrus, mango, lime, and melon. Moderate bitterness from the hops, with some pine, a little spice, and lemongrass. Very smooth, creamy body and mild carbonation. The finish is bitter and long-lasting.",Bissel Brothers Substance,/review/substance

"Huge spiced and fruit notes of mango, pineapple, and maybe a touch of coconut. The bitterness is balanced and maybe slightly accentuated by, the spices.

Finishes with a light alcohol harshness and a ton of coconut.",WeldWerks Fruity Bits Pina Colada,/review/fruity-bits-pina-colada
"A lactic tartness hits up front followed by some melon-fruit sweetness that helps to balance and cut through the acidity. The acidity and melon sweetness carry through the light and sweet finish. The saltiness only adds to the melon sweetness, which transitions to a medium-sour finish.",Anderson Valley Briney Melon Gose,/review/briney-melon-gose
Great hops presentation without being heavy handed. Malt supports without being sweet. Hops profile is a tasty blend of orange and pine with a simple malt backbone beneath. The orange has some sweetness with orange peel bitterness. Light hops flavor reprises the floral aroma and adds some citrus. Well balanced for the style.,SweetWater Brewing Company IPA,/review/sweetwater-ipa
"Big fruitiness up front with melon, ruby red grapefruit, tangerines, and a light cherry. A medium sweetness with a light alcohol warming that’s balanced and not over the top. The pleasant malt sweetness fades into a nice bitterness that doesn’t linger too long.",Transient Artisan Ales The Juice is Loose,/review/the-juice-is-loose
"Much more pronounced pineapple here, so vivid that I can almost feel the texture of the pineapple meat. Flickers of artificial pineapple candy kick in, along with some tartness that’s more from the fruit than the fermentation. The sweetness from the fruit almost overwhelms the sourness of the base beer. The mild <em>Brett</em> funk shines through once the sweetness subsides.",Epic Brewing Sour Brainless on Pineapple,/review/sour-brainless-on-pineapple
"Simple base beer, possibly with some wheat character and very subtle blueberry sweetness, but the fruit (strawberry, subtle blueberry, and some watermelon) is perceived mostly as light acidity and not clearly blueberry. The bready malt profile lingers through the full taste from start to finish. Fairly clean and dry with moderate carbonation.",SweetWater Brewing Company Blue,/review/sweetwater-blue
"A relatively clean biscuit and honey Pilsner malt, balanced by the herbal spiciness of the hops. Touches of red apple and orange add some complexity, but overall, a very restrained and understated flavor. Nothing is elbowing for control. Incredibly dry and clean fermentation.",Upland Brewing Company Champagne Velvet,/review/champagne-velvet
"Nice hops fruitiness with an even blend of blueberry, mango, and grapefruit rind. The hops bitterness and the light sweetness accentuate a piney hops character (a bit of Christmas tree) that helps balance and dry out the beer. A nice touch of boozy warmth also helps to fill out this beer. Bitterness lingers just a little too long, into the point of unwelcome aftertaste.",AleSmith Brewing Company Double IPA,/review/double-ipa
"Apricot, peach, cherry, raspberry. Far sweeter than expected, without the tartness common to apricot beers. Finishes with a drying sensation and a touch of tartness, but the sweetness lingers at the back of the palate. Sweet apricot juice taste jumps out and overwhelms the underlying beer. Little hops bitterness or malt qualities make this straightforward.",Samuel Smith's Brewery Apricot Ale,/review/samuel-smith-apricot-ale
"As in the aroma, a nice mix of grapefruit, mango, orange, peach, and melons with a touch of lemongrass for complexity. Moderate hops flavors and bitterness, with light melon and a slight banana flavor. A touch of sweetness that quickly dries out and a light spiciness that continues into the finish, leaving a low-level bitter aftertaste.",Brew Gentlemen General Braddock's,/review/general-braddocks
"High hops fruitiness of lemon and pear with a slight evidence of apple. Well-balanced among malt, hops, and yeast profiles. Medium-high carbonation. Clean dry finish.

"Blueberry, toast, honey, bran. Medium-light body with lightly toasted character and graham cracker/vanilla sweetness and complexity. Slight astringency on the finish, possibly from the blueberry-skin tannins. Fruit is forward, but not too sweet, and is in balance with the base beer. Light acidity, lively on tongue. Lingering sweetness.",Newport Storm Brewery Rhode Island Blueberry,/review/rhode-island-blueberry
"The combination of dark cherries with a peppery spiciness is very intriguing. This was supported by balanced tartness. The rich bready character blends well with the cherry esters. Acidity is restrained, but it brightens the finish nicely. Just a touch of sour in the tail.",Sun King Brewery Cherry Busey,/review/cherry-busey
"Tastes like a delicious casserole. Lots of curious flavors—roasted sweet red peppers, dank notes, and a hard-to-place umami richness. A bit boozy, but the crazy flavors hold up to it. The fine carbonation and slight sweetness remind you of the strength. A slight dank character as it warms, and it finishes with a light sweetness while the alcohol lingers.",Brew Gentlemen Kabuto,/review/kabuto
"Dark chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Holy sweetness! This reminds me very much of chocolate fondue. Medium roast notes toward the end of the sip. Aftertaste is very sweet and almost cloying with notes of mango and cantaloupe. Rich pipe tobacco and sweetness supported by dark chocolate and cherry tones. Medium dry mouthfeel through the finish, once the initial sweetness subsides.",Tree House Brewing Company That’s What She Said,/review/thats-what-she-said
"Complex dark fruit, mostly raspberry, raspberry jam. A bit of toasty malt and just a touch of chocolate. Some barnyard <em>Brett</em> funk as it warms up.

The malt supports well.",The Rare Barrel Ensorcelled (2016),/review/rare-barrel-ensorcelled
"Dark cherries really come out in the flavor with the vanilla, oak, and whiskey behind it. There's a cherry-cola character to it. Some darker richer malts in the background. Moderate sweetness, moderate-to-high acidity. Lots of body. High carbonation really makes the cherry tartness pop on top of the rich, dark character of the base beer. The roasted chocolate and darker malts blend well with the dark fleshy sweetness of the cherry. It finishes fairly dry with a chocolate-covered cherry quality.",Wicked Weed Brewing Black Angel,/review/black-angel
"Big pine and citrus notes couple with a superclean malt profile. Intense bitterness lingers long after the beer is swallowed. Nice and dry on the finish to accentuate the bitterness. Pine and citrus complexity—lemon and tangerine. Wonderful flavor—strong but not overwhelming and expands on the nose nicely. Good bitter foundation that anchors the finish. Very mild flash of alcohol warmth at the swallow, but smooth. Fairly dry.",Golden Road Brewing Wolf Among Weeds,/review/wolf-among-weeds
"Intense fruity and piney hops flavors. A touch of malt sweetness, but it hardly holds up to the intense hops bitterness that runs throughout, giving an intense grapefruit pithy character. A touch more carbonation could open things up a bit more. A light alcohol warming toward the end, but this is almost sessionable in its lightness.",Ballast Point Brewing Company Manta Ray,/review/manta-ray

Slight alcohol warmth aftertaste.",Avery Brewing Company Hog Heaven,/review/hog-heaven
"Intense citrus character with plenty of lingering bitterness. This is the first beer tonight that I would say pushes the ‘big’ end of the style. The malt is slightly bready and medium sweet, and the juicy hops flavor is huge; they play off each other well. Somewhat of a pine character is there in the back that coats the back of the throat.",Bear Republic Brewing Co. Café Racer 15,/review/cafe-racer-15
"Lots of raspberry, raspberry jam supported by a light base beer. Jolly Rancher–like candy taste of the raspberry is almost artificial. Dark cherry, blackberry, and a light honey-like complexity beneath. Cloyingly sweet up front that slowly fades into a low-to-moderate but somewhat astringent bitterness. Finishes slightly sweet, but also with the slight tannic character. A light hops bitterness helps lighten the body by cutting through the sweetness.",Founders Rubaeus,/review/rubaeus
"Big hops flavors of citrus, lemon, lemongrass, floral, and grassy notes up front, with a medium bitterness. Light bready toasted malt and fruity esters that complement the hops.

"Sweet malt, coriander, banana, lemon esters, and clove phenolics. Floral, spicy hops character. A Great classic tripel profile that’s ester-driven, light-bodied, and effervescent.

A nice, light malt sweetness pairs perfectly with a prominent bitterness that adds to the herbal spice character. Dangerously dry.",Breakside Brewery India Golden Ale,/review/india-golden-ale
"First impression is the taste of fresh passion fruit. Flavors of mango, papaya, lemon, lemongrass follow. Good underlying base beer with a subtle hops bitterness and supportive bready malt.

A lingering not-quite syrupy mouthfeel and nice lingering passion fruit in the aftertaste.",Concrete Beach Brewery Tropic of Passion,/review/tropic-of-passion

Strong nuttiness, with some earthy complexity. A touch of alcohol warmth and phenol qualities.",Wicked Weed Brewing Angel of Darkness,/review/angel-of-darkness
"Each berry carries a different part of the flavor. The tartness from the cranberry balances well with the delicate sweetness of the raspberry and the richness of the cherry. The base beer is a bit of a mystery, but is likely a sour brown of sorts. A supporting roasty malt profile that definitely supports the fruit flavors.  Good balance and complexity. Very drinkable with a great finish.",Rodenbach Brewery Caractere Rouge,/review/caractere-rouge
"Surprisingly intense juicy flavors, with melon, mango, and ruby red grapefruit dominating. Assertive hops and bitterness up front, with citrus grapefruit and lemongrass flavors. Nice flavor profile, and the sweetness slowly drops off as the hops bitterness intensifies, leaving a tart finish. Very well blended with the malt graininess.",Prison City Mass Riot,/review/mass-riot

"Moderate cherry note with very little sweetness and a hint of spice. The beer has a nice drying character after the start with some subtle tartness that’s mild but cleansing.

The acidic tartness helps to finish the beer out with a nice carbonation that leaves the beer a little warming.",Vanberg & DeWulf LambickX Oude Kriek,/review/lambicx-oude-kriek

Finishes with a long lasting bitterness that slowly grows. Have another sip before the bitterness grows too much.",Bronx Brewery No Resolution,/review/no-resolution
"Super dry and mineral-like with chocolate and raspberry beneath. A mix of cocoa powder and chalk. The fruit character just barely cuts through, with a nice pleasant sweetness. There’s a spiciness (I think I really want there to be chile peppers in this) that could be from alcohol. Numerous wood notes of oak and hickory. Medium body, mostly dry finish without being austere.",Burial Beer Co. Winnower,/review/winnower
"Dry blackberry, with jammy and juicy raspberries and a touch of sweetness on the back end. Earthiness, a limited amount of funk, and very low sweetness.

The aftertaste is simple and doesn’t linger.",Urban Artifact The Gadget ,/review/the-gadget
"The aroma continues into the flavor, with melon, peach, mango, complex grapefruit, and lemon notes—could almost taste like a sour to a beer rookie. A medium malt background is sweet and bready.

"Orange, tangerine, lime, lemon, and it’s zesty and pulpy, lightly tart, and refreshing. The malt is a bready wheat with a nice cracker that’s cut with rye. Some pepper and spice, and an undercurrent of Earl Grey, bergamot, and herbal dankness. Creamy mouthfeel and some fruity esters that end in a nice, dry finish.",Harpoon Brewery UFO Twist,/review/ufo-twist
"Well balanced clean toasty malt with a floral and herbal hops presence and a touch of citrus peeking through. Bright and crisp with a moderate lingering bitterness. Carbonation is spot on. There aren’t many rough edges to this beer, making it pretty easy drinking.",Coronado Brewing Company Idiot IPA,/review/idiot-ipa
Screams raspberry with low-to-moderate sweetness that quickly transitions into high acidity. Huge tart raspberry esters pull everything together.  Some nice bready notes and subtle funkiness provide support to balance things out.,Toolbox Brewing Company Saison Rustique Framboise,/review/saison-rustique-framboise
"A blend of light malt sweetness, bright hops juiciness, and perfect bitterness to keep it in balance. Hops flavors are intense and complex, with mandarin oranges, peaches, and melon. The malt, though a touch sweet, is layered with a touch of biscuit and bread, and a creamy body. Strong esters, and a slight minerality that accentuates some bitterness. Dank notes are in the background, and the finish is bitter with hops flavors and long lasting.",Prison City Nope on a Rope,/review/nope-on-a-rope
"Light bodied, slightly sweet, clean base beer with just the right amount of mango. The esters from the fruit are well-balanced with the beer, and the mango itself is perfectly ripe. Medium bready malt. Some low hops bitterness, low acidity, and  very dry.",Atwater Brewery Whango,/review/whango
"Huge chocolaty flavors, coupled with a unique citrus hops character, give it a chocolate orange note that works well with the rich nature of this beer. There’s some roast and toasted marshmallow in there, whiskey, umami notes, and dark cherry esters. The body is thick and chewy and almost viscous, but there’s enough heat and roast bitterness for balance.",Hoppin' Frog Rocky Mountain D.O.R.I.S.,/review/rocky-mountain-d-o-r-i-s
Heavy on the grapefruit rind with a healthy amount of dankness and slight onion. A touch of malt sweetness keeps the hops from taking over. An assertive bitterness provides some balance without getting aggressive. Light spices are well balanced with the bitterness.,Creature Comforts Brewery Cosmik Debris 2017,/review/cosmik-debris-2017
"Peaches and cream, with a heavy dose of sweetness. The malt is soft, bread-like, and doughy—very big for the style, and the touch of vanilla puts it over the top. The hops bitterness is low for the style, but definitely there. The finish is drier than expected, with little lingering sweetness.",WeldWerks Brewing Co. Fruity Bits Peaches and Cream,/review/fruity-bits-peaches-and-cream
"Assertive hops bitterness that lingers and sticks to the teeth. The flavor hits with an interesting complexity, adding grapefruit sweetness and pineapple that extends into the finish as it warms. Dank earthiness on the finish.",The Alchemist Focal Banger,/review/focal-banger
"The raspberries aren’t too sweet, are nice and tart, and carry through the entire taste. The tartness is right in line with the flavor, with light Lacto and a touch of cherry and lime. Moderate dryness and a roasty and toasty malty backbone. More Brett here in the flavor—nice and earthy.",Societe Brewing Company The High Binder,/review/the-high-binder
"Moderately sweet and bitter, with a blend of fruity and earthy hops. Lots of orange, mango, and tangerine. Dank, piney hops along with notes of resin, onion, grass, and cat. As the beer warms, the sharper flavors emerge, with the pine and resin rounding out the back end.",Trillium Scaled Up,/review/scaled-up
"Strong citrus notes up front with strong grapefruit, lemon, and lime from the hops, and tropical fruit. The earthy funk from the hops leans toward pine and resin and adds complexity without being distracting. The aftertaste is a bit grassy with a touch of lemongrass and apricot at the tail end.",Funkwerks Dry Hopped Provincial,/review/dry-hopped-provincial
"Where the aroma was more focused on juicy, the flavor highlights more rind-like citrus flavors, heightened by a nice amount of bitterness. The malt sweetness expertly balances out the bitterness and brings out a nice ruby red grapefruit juice flavor on the back end.",Eel River Brewing Company Earth Thirst Double IPA,/review/earth-thirst-double-ipa
"Big tropical juicy hops notes with big juicy grape. Moderate acidity and tannins, with a bit of wine character. Bready malt and low-to-moderate sweetness that’s balanced by moderately high (and lingering) bitterness and dryness.",Trillium Brewing Company Dialed In Sauvignon Blanc,/review/dialed-in-sauvignon-blanc
"Lots of hops going on, with a slight tartness up front and a sturdy body behind it. The sharp, hoppy, earthy flavors have a touch of pine, resin, and dankness with moderate-to-high bitterness. Notes of tangerine, pineapple, and mandarin show through and are not smooth and straight fruit, but more like a more aggressive West Coast IPA. The bitterness and hoppy resin linger on the tongue after the taste.",The Alchemist Broken Spoke,/review/broken-spoke
"Light and delicate, with some sweet light cracker-like notes that carry through. Herbal and floral hops add some unusual woody dankness and bitterness, as well as a lemon-like citrus complexity, without being overpowering. Perfectly fermented, with a fresh, clean, dry finish.",Terrapin Beer Company Sound Czech Pils,/review/sound-czech-pils
"The citrus and hops flavors blend into an appealing mélange, with the quality of the citrus rind combining with a balance of malt and hops. Orange comes through more than tangerine and is fairly restrained in the mix—comes across as a standard IPA with good citrus and resinous hops flavors, with a clean bitterness, and light, bready malt. The hops bitterness is moderate, playing a supportive role. The malt is sweet, with a nice biscuit character.",Stone Brewing Co. Tangerine Express IPA,/review/tangerine-express-ipa
"As in the aroma, there’s lots of intense dark fruit, blueberry, and cherry along with lemon and lemongrass. The lactic and blueberry sweetness are very rich and well blended. Tannins (probably from the fruit) help round things out and make you want another sip. Finishes dry.",Side Project Brewing Bleuet du Fermier,/review/bleuet-du-fermier
"Moderate hops flavors with juicy peach notes, candy sweetness, orange, and pineapple, like orange marmalade. A big bread flavor with medium rye spiciness and a touch of caramel. A mustiness gives it an almost mushroom-like earthiness. The hops bitterness and rye create a spicy, bitter finish, but the bitterness is on the low end for how much heat is in the finish.",50 West Punch You in the EyePA,/review/punch-you-in-the-eyepa
"Juicy peach and passion fruit meet earthy <em>Brett</em> funk. Light tartness throughout with a bit of bitterness in the finish. Creamy consistency with a dry finish and pleasant effervescence. A bit of herbal hops in the background. Some apricot and lemon esters balanced with spicy phenolics and a bit of barnyard, leather funk.",Beachwood Blendery Propagation Series 128,/review/propagation-series-128
"Complex citrus hops character (blood orange, grapefruit pith) with a little nice pineapple, and substantial bitterness, but enough bright malt character that provides a good balance to the hops with some sweetness and residual sugars. Mouthfeel is great with a dry finish. Hops bitterness lingers but is not unpleasant and to be expected from this style.",Green Flash Brewing Company West Coast IPA,/review/green-flash-west-coast-ipa
"Light and crisp, with a balance of bitter from the hops and citrus. Wonderfully dry, with pithy citrus flavors—the orange and grapefruit rind are well-matched with the resinous piney hops. Moderately high esters, with a splash of malt right before the swallow pops the hops back into focus, with a bitterness that coats the tongue and encourages another sip.",Southern Tier Brewing Company Tangier Session IPA,/review/tangier-session-ipa
"Funky peaches (peach pie with a slice of lemon) with a lot going on. The sweetness of the ripe peaches combines with an earthy funk. The acid sourness helps to support the complexity, and the high carbonation level gives it a nice light feel. Really like the balance and mouthfeel.",Toolbox Brewing Company Mackinaw Batch #2,/review/mackinaw-batch-2
"A blend of overripened citrus and unique malt flavors of sweet biscuit, light caramel, and bread crust. The moderate hops bitterness includes grassy and floral hops more than tropical citrus hops. The malt gives it a chewy consistency, and there’s a moderate alcohol warming, but the sweetness lingers into the finish.",The Veil Broz Night out,/review/broz-night-out
Big chocolate with sweetness that slowly builds and then fades into slight bitterness and a hint of acidity in the finish. Caramel and roasted malt support. Moderately dry finish. There is a creamy (vanilla) sweetness to this beer that makes it taste like chocolate milk.,Speakeasy Ales & Lagers Black Hand,/review/black-hand
"Rich, vinous dark fruits quickly give way to intense acidity, which isn’t overly harsh or overwhelming. The sour notes are funky and tart, cutting the sweetness. High carbonation takes the tartness just a little too high, but the overall effect is very dry and not overly harsh. The finish is light lactic, with low sweetness and a moderate tartness.",The Rare Barrel In Other Words,/review/in-other-words
"Orange and pine carry over from the aroma and saturate the flavor profile. Clean hops flavors, a kiss of caramel, and a nicely balanced bitterness make a beautiful impression on the palate. A drier IPA with fruit notes of grapefruit and lime. Low malt note to round out the flavor. The carbonation and lime notes at the end create a surprising bite, but not in a bad way. Almost a slight hint of a roast character. The juiciness of this beer is alluring.",La Cumbre Brewing Company Elevated IPA,/review/elevated-ipa
"Hops profile is explosive! Tropical flavors, citrus-peel bitter, lightly caramel sweet, lingering bitterness.",Heavy Seas Beer Double  Cannon,/review/double-cannon
"The orange comes through more on the tongue, with pithy and astringent qualities from the rind. Grapefruit notes mix with lemon, followed by toasty and biscuit malt. The bitterness counteracts the malty backbone well, lingering long after the flavor is gone, without being overwhelming. Spicy hops tend to be overwhelmed by the bitterness of the orange.",Ska Brewing Co. Modus Mandarina India Pale Ale,/review/modus-mandarina-india-pale-ale
"Fruit-flavor layers on top, bringing in flavors of boysenberry, blackberry, and bananas. With the high acidity and sourness, the effect is almost wine-like.

A dry finish, with a nice lingering note of currant in the aftertaste.","Epic Brewing Oak and Orchard Blueberry, Boysenberry & Black Currant",/review/oak-and-orchard-blueberry-boysenberry-and-black-currant
"Moderate fruity malt sweetness up front with a big grassy, woody, and earthy hops flavor and moderate bitterness. Stone-fruit esters and low-level peppery phenolics dominate, with a touch of malt sweetness to support. There is an odd through-line of sharp bitterness that doesn’t really dissipate until long after the swallow. Tastes more like a Belgian golden strong than a New England IPA.",Harpoon Hoppy Adventure,/review/Harpoon-hoppy-adventure
"Big caramel and dark fruit sweetness, light earthy hops, touch of plum, very light oxidation (sherry). Balanced and blended well with the spice and earthiness and the malt sweetness that carries through with notes of toast, chocolate sweetness. Finishes with a slight toast and bittersweet chocolate character.",Fort Collins Brewery Oldwyn,/review/oldwyn
There’s plenty of malt sweetness in this beer to balance the intense hoppy character. Bitterness and hops flavor shine through with citrus and pine as in the aroma. Clean otherwise and distubingly drinkable for the ABV. Slight bready character from the malt provides some sweetness. Really dry finish without a lot of hops presence with the exception of a citrus note.,"Knee Deep Brewing Company No Seeds,  No Stems",/review/no-seeds-no-stems
"The orange-peel flavor is light and wedged somewhere between the malt and hops but doesn’t heighten either. The hops are grassy, floral, resinous, and bitter, and the malt is clean and bready. A little astringency in there, with a light, crisp body. Mildly soapy character, with a bit of bitterness in the finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Company Sidecar Orange Pale Ale,/review/sidecar-orange-pale-ale
"A nice blend of dark roasted malt and sour. The cherry character is more pronounced on the palate than on the aroma, and it helps to pull together the slightly harsh roasted character and the lactic/acetic sour, although the flavors seem to be competing with each other. The dark richness of the cherries shines through more with every sip and comes through in aftertaste and lingers long. It’s fairly full body but still dry.",Odell Brewing Company Dark Theory,/review/dark-theory
"Moderate bitterness, with a chalky, orange-flavored vitamins character most likely derived from the malt, with some pineapple in the background. Low tropical and peach fruit flavors, along with some sweetness from the malt. The hops taste a bit muddy, muted, and grassy and fading to vegetal. There’s a bit of a catty hops note with an herbal sting.",Mosaic IPA Lost Nation,/review/lost-nation
"A classic dubbel flavor profile, replete with raisins, toffee, bananas, and a touch of clove. High carbonation, but smooth nonetheless. Carbonic bite is a little overpowering, though. Rich malt base, overlaid with dark fruit esters, and a dry finish.",Brouwerij Westvleteren Westvleteren 8,/review/westvleteren-8
"Wonderful, complex pine and citrus hops character blends nicely with just enough malt sweetness to balance and give it a soft body. Beer is slightly sweet for the style until the very finish which is nice and dry.",Lagunitas Brewing Company Maximus,/review/maximus
"Bergamot, tangerine, and herbal notes up front, with some grapefruit pith and hops. Moderate esters bring in notes of cherry and blueberry, which play nicely with the citrus, the lemongrass, and bitterness of the hops. Light simple malt bill adds a supportive caramel-malt character. It’s well-balanced and not too aggressively bitter, if a bit too pithy. Dry finish, very clean.",Schlafly Beer Grapefruit IPA,/review/schlafly-grapefruit-ipa
"Puckering sour with strawberry, boysenberry, and blackberry in a light body. Some hops bitterness. As it warms, the berries come out. The sweet dark berry start flows into a semidry tart finish. Hint of tannins add some complexity. Nice balance.",Bruery Terreux Frucht Boysenberry,/review/frucht-boysenberry
"Vanilla, brown sugar, and caramel sweetness at first taste, with a touch of pumpkin-pie spices (mostly ginger) to support. The sweetness gives way to the ginger spiciness. The vanilla/caramel flavor comes through a bit artificial, but still works well in the beer. Also tastes of lemon and some earthiness. Finishes slightly astringent and sharp.",Southern Tier Brewing Company Pumking,/review/pumking
"Crisp and sour, it’s tart, but not too tart. Strong carbonic bite plus notes of lemon, orange, and even some sharp pineapple flavor. Cherry as it warms. Funky <em>Brett</em> and barnyard-like notes mix with a medium tartness. Just the right amount of carbonation to carry the complex flavors. Slight salty, lime notes after the sip. The tartness hits more in the finish and stays at the top of the tongue.",Allagash Brewing Company Nancy,/review/nancy
"Slightly sweet, rich, toasted and caramel notes from the base beer and plenty of body carry the blood orange esters. The dark citrus complexity is nicely blended, but the mustiness on the aroma carried through to the flavor. The finish is slightly numbing and sweet. Pithy from the rind of the blood oranges",Buffalo Bill’s Brewery Blood Orange Imperial Ale,/review/blood-orange-imperial-ale
Juicy orange and malt sweetness up front with some pine-like hops character. The sweetness almost offsets the bitterness from the piney hops. Hops bitterness lingers pleasantly.,Melvin Brewing 2x4 Double IPA,/review/2x4-double-ipa
"The citrus flavor is fresh and lively, with flavors from the juice, pith, and peel of the grapefruit. Biscuit malt sweetness is obvious, and the complexity brings out the juiciness of the citrus. The hops are piney and dank, with the bitterness keeping it from being too sweet and juicy. Just a hint of the perfume that was present on the nose, and a bit of burn in the aftertaste that lingers with it.",Samuel Adams Rebel Grapefruit IPA,/review/rebel-grapefruit-ipa
"Rich, tart berry esters, especially lots of blackberry and raspberry. The raspberry has a cooked quality and is rich, tart, and slightly short of ripe. The sweetness from the malt and the fruits supports the sourness—it’s like a Pop-Tart with a hint of lemon. The <em>Brett</em> character is stronger here, with notes of leather and woodiness, along with the funk. Bright floral notes shine through, along with more of the complex esters.",Adelbert's Brewery Raspberry Sour,/review/raspberry-sour
"Big sweetness, with moderate caramel and apple (like caramel apples), brown sugar, dark fruit (plum, prune, raisin), and a sweetness that carries through to the finish. The body is creamy and sweet and balances well with the faint smoke character.",Hardywood Park Trickery,/review/trickery
"The juiciness and fruitiness of the peach come through much more on the flavor, with the herbal and grassy hops playing more of a supporting role. Lots of sweetness up front for an IPA from the bready malts, which also work to support the fruity esters. Floral hops flavors are present, but not enough bitterness for an IPA. The finish is dry.",Odell Brewing Company Tree Shaker Imperial Peach IPA,/review/tree-shaker-imperial-peach-ipa
"Passion fruit dominates, but there are some mango notes. Saltiness comes through on the back, bringing together the fruit and adding complexity. Rather dry on the finish. Tartness is  just light of making the mouth pucker. Finishes refreshing.",WeldWerks Brewing Co. Double Passion Fruit Gose,/review/double-passion-fruit-gose
"Very delicate in the flavor. Watermelon comes through as the biggest dominator but is still subtle. Touch of lime and moderate hops bitterness. Pilsner/pale malt sweetness and some huskiness comes through and provides the dominant flavor profile. Aftertaste: big melon rind (touch of bitter there too), touch of watermelon, moderately sweet, touch of lime, light lactic acidity, light hops bitterness. Finishes lightly dry.",New Belgium Brewing Juicy Watermelon,/review/juicy-watermelon
"The hops flavors are resinous, and provide lots of fruit flavors that carry throughout the beer, showcasing each fruit: grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, light orange, and peach. Yeasty, bready body that’s soft and fluffy. Some earthy funkiness in the middle, with a light piney bitterness and a touch of malt in the finish.",Odd 13 Fairy Hopmother,/review/fairy-hopmother
"Light and well-balanced with a substantial bitterness to balance the nice honey sweetness with some bready malt character. Hops are a complex blend of orange, lemon, and pine with some herbal complexity in the finish. The alcoholic heat from the aroma isn’t nearly as present. Hops bitterness lingers, and the hops flavor lingers lightly into the aftertaste.",New Belgium Brewing Company Voodoo  Ranger IIPA,/review/voodoo-ranger-iipa
"Mandarin orange with a grapefruit kicker—comes through like a grapefruit orange soda. It’s sweet, dry, and slightly acidic. Some cherry esters and bready malt to remind you it’s beer, but the citrus is so dominant the hops are playing second fiddle, aside from the bitterness that lingers into the finish. The citrus rind finish lingers.",Heavy Seas Beer TropiCannon Citrus IPA,/review/tropicannon-citrus-ipa
"Raspberry shines through with an interesting pivot point with the chocolate/roast malt. The roast malt helps cut through the sweetness up front. Bright acidity comes through on the back but finishes somewhat dry. Very inviting beer with some complexity. Bright fruit with some malt sweetness. You would expect it to be a heavier, but it has all the flavor yet is still refreshing.",Urban Artifact Slide Rule,/review/slide-rule
"Assertive lactic tartness and acidity emerge up front, with flavors of lemon and lime, reminiscent of a Lemon Warhead. The stone-fruit and pear flavors play a background role and add complexity, which works with the light body to balance the level of acidity. The acidity dissipates quickly, leaving a dry malt sweetness in the aftertaste.",Funkwerks Apricot Provincial,/review/apricot-provincial
"Tart citrus flavor that reminds me of Smarties candy, even with a light chalkiness. Chewy body with a medium carbonation. Finishes with a medium tartness that is medium lasting. As it warms, the peach and cherries start to come out. From the funk, it tastes like my grandfather's tack room smelled: straw, dust, sweat, leather. Low overall fruit with intense citric acidity. Very dry.",TRVE Brewing Company Restarter,/review/restarter
"The first sip brings out the bready malt, with a touch of hops flavor that yields to the bitterness. Light nuttiness that might be a bit out of place, as well as some fresh fruitiness. Subsequent sips see the hops flavors build in complexity—spicy, with a big of evergreen pine. Some lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, clean fermentation.",Hopworks Urban Brewery HUB Lager,/review/hub-lager
"The grapefruit pithiness ushers in a healthy dose of dank, piney, resinous, tart hops. The grapefruit flavor is mostly rind, but a bit of juice. Biscuit maltiness on the back end and some caramel malt sweetness lend a fullness to the body and round it out. Floral esters and the hops bitterness linger through the aftertaste.",Ghostfish Brewing Company Grapefruit IPA,/review/grapefruit-ipa

"Spicy, resinous pine is most pronounced, yet underneath, fruity notes of orange, lemon, and citrus are present. Big sweetness that transitions into a medium bitterness toward the finish.

"Lots of flavor and very drinkable—slight tartness and fruit notes with hints of apple juice, pear, orange, and lemon. The tartness hits toward the finish to help clean the beer out.

Carbonation is spot on. Very frefreshing yet complex.",Wicked Weed Brewing The Parking Lot Grissette,/review/the-parking-lot-grissette
"Such subdued flavor, which is surprising, given the hint of sour acetic in the aroma. Delicate clove and pepper phenols. Some great citrus notes of orange and lemon develop, and even more lemon in the aftertaste. The banana esters are on the lighter side, and balance with the sweet wheat and bread crust malts. Creamy and medium-light body, but a dry finish.",C. B. & Potts Big Horn Hefeweizen,/review/big-horn-hefeweizen
"The flavor surprises with strong hops bitterness throughout. Some interesting malt complexity, with a touch of honey, caramel, biscuit, and bread crust.

The finish is like grapefruit pith—hard to get out of your mouth.",Roc Brewing Co. Whoopass,/review/whoopass
"The orange character is pronounced up front but quickly fades behind a pithy bitterness and a touch of malt sweetness and becomes a fruity citrus with the swallow. Simple and estery with hints of cherry and banana and just a touch of caramel malt sweetness. Woody, earthy, and herbal hops lend a note of bitterness that’s not overwhelming. Light on carbonation and body, and a delicate flavor profile overall.",Elysian Brewing Company Superfuzz Blood Orange Pale Ale,/review/superfuzz-blood-orange-pale-ale
Bright orange and tangerine notes dominate up front with a touch of lime.

Carbonation carries the beer well.,Sudwerk Brewing Co. Farmer's Market Citrus Gose Lager,/review/farmers-market-citrus-gose-lager
"The first impression is of juicy tangerine—citrus is everywhere throughout, including the citrus rind on the finish, but the citrus is watered down. Mild tropical hops, possibly Citra, with some coconut and pineapple notes, and balancing bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily and flat, with not enough carbonation, and mineral notes in the aftertaste.",New Belgium Brewing Citradelic,/review/citradelic
"The sip has the same floral presence, with brightness from the citrus esters, and cherry, pear, ripe apple, and strawberry enter, along with some coriander, black pepper, and ginger. The citrus is more lemon than orange. Tart wheat supports, with the graininess helping the beer to finish very dry.",Celis Brewing Company Celis White,/review/celis-white
"The flavor is better than the nose, with definite wheat malt and bread character. Still some of the smoky phenolics and some plastic balloon, but not as strong as in the aroma. As it warms, some caramel flavor comes out, with some butterscotch. Some banana esters and clove.",Ayinger Brewery Bräuweisse,/review/braeuweisse
"Hops bitterness up front similar to a pale ale, with light sweetness. The hops are mostly pine with a little dankness and earth. There isn’t a lot of malt, and the wheat is more of an afterthought. A hint of smoke and astringency.",Ballast Point Brewing Company Homework Series #8,/review/homework-series-8
"Lots of earthy, musty, leathery, barnyard funk followed by pie cherries and toasty malt.  Moderate sweetness supports the fruit. High carbonation. Some vanilla qualities. Rich toasted character from the malt in the base beer supports the barnyard character well, blending caramel, leather, and horse blanket. The cherry character plays a supporting role. It is sweet and fleshy with just a slight tartness.",Societe Brewing Company The Savage,/review/the-savage
"High hops flavor up front with bit citrus notes. Moderate chocolate with big roasty notes support the hops. Quite sweet up front. Sweetness slowly fades into a low bitterness. Toward the end, slight smoke note but big hops that continue into the aftertaste with a mix of roast. Dry, bitter hoppy finish. As it warms, the smoke turns into a burnt molasses note. Very fruity: passion fruit and pineapple. Finish is sweet and lingers. Rich chewy body that doesn’t come across as thick. Big pine and orange flavors from the hops. Chocolate from the malt gives it a chocolate orange flavor. The sweetness comes together with all the different bold flavors and finishes with a slightly dry finish.",Revolution Brewing Company Rise,/review/rise
"The orange dominates on the flavor, along with some raw, grainy wheat, which supports an estery blend of orange, lemon, and vanillin. A great blend of citrus and coriander with the spice ascendant—it’s piney, flowery, and woody. The carbonation is a bit low, and the body drops off very quickly. It’s dry and somewhat thin. Light honeysuckle emerges as it warms.",Harpoon Brewery UFO White,/review/ufo-white
"Way out of style for a wit, and the hoppiness is the star of the show, ranging from floral, catty, and fruity to piney, citrusy, and earthy.

The wheat and malt balance the flavor, but the finish is dry and bitter.",Lagunitas Brewing Company Stoopid Wit,/review/stoopid-wit

It’s very dry, with an intensely bitter finish.",Lagunitas Brewing Company Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’,/review/little-sumpin-sumpin
"The malt sweetness and esters stand out first, giving the beer a Bit-O-Honey character. Then the orange, which has the bitter qualities of the rind but is strongest in the aftertaste.

"Sweet and heavy up front, almost like a braggot or a tripel, but with less hops and more honey. The honey character dries out as you move toward the finish, and there’s a slight burn on the back end with lingering citrus and honey. Some herbal and spice notes that verge on medicinal. Toasty and bready Pilsner malt with a fair amount of caramel, toasty malt, and then some herbal and spice notes. The finish is dry with a bit of warmth.",Brasserie Lefèbvre SA Barbãr,/review/barbar
"The aroma suggested a more hops-forward flavor than comes through. A delicate balance of low bready malt character with a hint of graham cracker and a bit of earthy and herbal hops.

The finish is a touch bitter and a little watery.",Odell Brewing Company Easy Street Wheat,/review/easy-street-wheat
"The coriander is a touch overpowering, but it’s a great witbier that’s fresh, with a crisp, light body, and quite clear.

A very clean, dry finish, with a low yeast character.”",New Belgium Brewing Sunshine Wheat,/review/sunshine-wheat
"This is on the sweeter side, with a caramel-and-toffee bent. Some malt richness is fairly understated, some pastry crust, and honey that lingers through the finish.

The finish is dry, with a hint of bitterness.",Wiley Roots Brewing Company Super 77,/review/super-77
"The piney, grassy, citrusy hops flavor hits up front and sticks through the finish. Next up is a light lemony tartness that fades to a mild citrusy bitterness.

Some faint soapiness and moderate acidity, but overall, there is not a lot going on.",Telluride Brewing Company Whacked Out Wheat,/review/whacked-out-wheat
"Spicy rye-like character with hops-driven flavors of orange, mango, and peach. Solid malt structure with substantial body and residual sweetness to keep bitterness in check.

"Lightly tart bready flavor, with a malty sweetness that gives a full-bodied texture. Cleaner phenols here, primarily clove and some smoke, with some bright banana.

Perhaps a little aggressive for a German-style wheat, but light for an American-style wheat.",Boulevard Brewing Company Unfiltered Wheat,/review/unfiltered-wheat
"Starts off with more of the peanut butter and banana sandwich, with a hint of honey. A soft wheat body, and the honey enhances the aromatics.

Moderately sweet and bitter but finishes reasonably dry.",Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Snow Drop,/review/snow-drop
"A great balance of coriander and orange peel with light esters from the yeast—the orange, lemon, and bubblegum blend well with the richness from the wheat. Strong malt and honey notes, and the notes of orange blossom, grape soda, and coriander are forward but not harsh or edgy. The palate is soft and drier than the fruity taste and nose would indicate.",Coronado Brewing Company Orange  Ave. Wit,/review/orange-ave-wit
"Complex blend of strawberry, bubblegum, orange, and a touch of lemon. The wheat character supports and adds richness; the phenolics are more subtle than on the aroma.

"Orange, with some of the bitter pith and zest. Lemony citrus and white grape with some funkiness and tartness that compete with the coriander and peppery phenols. Moderately low sweetness, and some subtle raw wheat and bready malt that didn’t quite balance with the bitterness. Body is dry, thin, and somewhat watery. There’s a carbonic bite that hangs on through the finish.",Ghostfish Brewing Company Shrouded Summit,/review/shrouded-summit
"Really interesting flavor. After the aroma, one might expect this to be a citrus/lemon bomb, but it has some interesting herbal notes to balance the tartness of the lemon and tartness. It’s really dry in the finish, but you get this nice residual sweetness from the malt that allows the tartness and citrus to linger. It tastes like lemon herbal tea, and the flavors balanced well together. Not too sweet, not too tart.",Terrapin Beer Company T-Time,/review/t-time
"The malt sweetness helps to drive this beer. Nice orange and citrus notes blend into the flavor but are not sharp. Moderate caramel sweetness, moderate-high resiny hops bitterness. Some vanilla. Finishes sweet but not too sweet with some slight oak tannins.",Left Hand Brewing Company Widdershins,/review/widdershins
"A cornucopia of fruits: kiwi, watermelon, cherry, pineapple, and lychee nut. Bready malt is more Pilsner than wheat, with toasted bread verging on coconut, caramel, and burned sugar. While the impression is sweet, the beer isn’t all that sweet. Crisp hops bitterness, with a bit of grass. Some spiciness emerges in the middle of the sip and fades quickly to a finish with light bread and herbal hops flavors.",Erdinger Weißbier,/review/weissbier
"The wheat flavor in this one is soft, with a smooth creamy body and light carbonation. Crisp hops bitterness without being dominant that provides balance and character. Moderately sweet banana esters, but the phenol is less pronounced. The finish is dry, with a touch of light bitterness. The style is Germanic, but not excessively so.",Hacker- Pschorr Weisse,/review/weisse
"A chewy wheat flavor up front, with light banana, honey, and a touch of spice. The hops bitterness is medium-low, and nicely balances the malt with a bit of resinous, woody character.  A light touch of melon sweetness appears in the middle of the sip, with a bit of bitterness at the end of the sip. A very fresh yeast profile.",Harpoon Brewery UFO  Hefeweizen,/review/ufo-hefeweizen
"Lemon, lemongrass, grapefruit, bready. Moderate sweetness, moderate-to-high firm bitterness that balances the body nicely. Body and mouthfeel are spot on, with an underlying sweetness that offsets most of the finishing bitterness. Relatively high carb, which makes it pop on the palate.",Brouwerij West Picnic Lightning,/review/picnic-lightning
"On the first swallow, overripe fruit flavors come through, with sweet, tart passion fruit that dominates and lingers. Juicy and fresh, with a balancing bitterness from the grapefruit rind and hops that lasts into the finish. Bready biscuit malt sweetness adds complexity, and the same spicy, estery character in the aroma is in the flavor.",Boulevard Brewing Company Tropical Pale Ale,/review/tropical-pale-ale
"Bready wheat flavor that’s very clean, with a hint of lemon. It’s well-composed with the balancing hops bitterness. The yeast is mostly banana and other fruit esters. Not the classic Bavarian hefe character, but not out of line for an American wheat. The sulfur carries through the finish, with light dryness and spice.",Schlafly Beer Hefeweizen,/review/hefeweizen
"Everything seems to blend together. Rich dark caramel, plum, and cherry notes with moderate sourness. Finishes slightly astringent with a lingering sourness and plum ester character and some <em>Brett</em> funk. Residual sweetness improves drinkability. Aftertaste is smooth and not aggressive—‘more-ish.’ ",EPIC Brewing Oak and Orchard Dark Sour with Plum,/review/oak-and-orchard-dark-sour-with-plum
"Mango really shines through with some sweetness but not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Still, it’s not very tart for a kettle sour, and there’s only a light hops bitterness. The body is somewhat thin.",Golden Road Brewing Tart Mango Cart,/review/tart-mango-cart
"Wheat and rye malts, with some tartness from the grain. A grassy noble hops background that’s a bit sharp, but well-balanced by the creamy malt profile. The fermentation character is solid Bavarian, with light white grape and banana fruitiness. The phenols are clove and pepper, with some green pepper elements. Finishes dry, with a touch of clove.",La Cumbre Brewing Slice of Hefen,/review/slice-of-hefen
"Rich banana sweetness, with immense chewy wheat. Grassy hops and bitterness are evenly balanced with the bready wheat malt and linger through the finish. Yeast esters and phenolics are interesting without dominating. Some fusel high alcohols and light pork come through in the finish.",Hofbrau Hefe Weizen,/review/hefe-weizen
"A spot-on flavor profile for a dubbel with fruit esters (light raisins, banana, and clove) that dominate, but don’t overwhelm the satisfying deep malt body. Hops bitterness is moderate but sufficient to balance the beer. High carbonation. The flavor is much bigger than the aroma suggests.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus St. Bernardus Prior 8,/review/st.-bernardus-prior-8
"Tart and spicy wheat, with dark and melanoidin malts, caramel chews, and toast. A pleasant hit of clove that works so well with the raisin, jackfruit, and mild banana. Subtle burnt sugar, along with a hint of popcorn and minty hops. The carbonation is prickly, and it finishes crisp and dry.",Schneider Weisse Original,/review/original
"Spiciness hits up front, with a soft bready wheat malt flavor. Grainy, like porridge, but with raw, tart wheat. Black pepper and clove phenols but not much hops flavor, aside from a hint of lemon, which feels out of balance. Esters of melon and cherry. The finish is quick with some wheat and clove.",WeldWerks Brewing Company Hefeweizen,/review/hefeweizen-ww
Nice light bready malt flavor in the start. Lemon and orange in the middle beneath a strong peach backbone. Malt is clean and supporting without being sweet. Finish is bitter but not aggressive. Very smooth and well balanced.,Central Standard Brewing Wizard of Hops,/review/wizard-of-hops
"The flavor proceeds directly from the aroma. But where the aroma indicated a rich muffin, this is more of a scone, or a muffin without the butter. A smooth, rich blend of blueberry and wheat, with hints of vanilla cashew. A hint of sweetness that fades into a restrained bitterness that lingers into a dry finish.",High Hops Brewery Blueberry Wheat,/review/blueberry-wheat
"Intense orange flavors, with some incredible depth, bringing in flavors from the entire fruit, yet managing not to dominate. The thick, dank hops flavor adds a nice blend of bitterness and citrus. The dry malt character adds sweetness and some honey at the finish.",Blue Point Brewing Company Citrus Plunge IPA,/review/citrus-plunge-ipa
"Wheat up front, with clove spiciness. The burnt phenols are more muted on the taste. The banana and bubblegum esters are stronger in the flavor, with a hint of tartness, and a nice clove zing on the finish. Moderate carbonation, chewy body, and a dry finish. The vegetal flavor starts to dissipate as it warms and becomes much sweeter.",Tröegs Independent Brewing Dream Weaver,/review/dream-weaver
"The wheat body of the base beer is great for the fruitiness of the beer, and has a bit of breadiness and sweetness, and is light and dry. The fruit notes in the flavor aren’t specific to strawberry but also include white grape, citrus, and watermelon rind—the strawberry is especially present in the retronasal exhale. The hops flavors are citrusy, slightly grassy, providing balance. Light and dry, with a tart, astringent, lightly bitter finish.",Declaration Brewing Company Veiled Vixen Strawberry Wheat,/review/veiled-vixen-strawberry-wheat
"Jammy, like blueberry, but it also has an artificial flavor, kind of like BooBerry cereal. More notes of blackberry, cherry, and raspberry, with some oily orangey citrus, apricot. Anise, fennel, and caraway poke out from under the fruit as the beer warms. While the fruity sweetness dominates, there is some wit yeast character as well, with a medium body and a lasting sweet, bitter finish.",Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company Sunset Wheat,/review/sunset-wheat
"Bright acidity from the pineapple that dominates at the front and a big, juicy flavor profile that really delivers on fruit. A touch of mango at the back, with slightly green tropical fruit. Moderate <em>Lacto</em> acidity and funk, a very light touch of hops bitterness, and just a hint of salt. Mouth-filling carbonation, thin body, and a nice dryness that’s an invitation to another sip.",Funkwerks Pineapple Provincial,/review/pineapple-provincial
"Bright and rich fruity flavors of ripe pineapple, candied orange, and mango. The dankness is much more subdued and provides just a touch of complexity. Nice malt sweetness and creamy mouth feel. A touch of bitterness that grows after the sip, but malt and juicy hops flavors dominate.",WeldWerks Brewing Co. Alpha Bits #5,/review/alpha-bits-5
"Caramel malt sweetness and a hint of pumpkin open, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger or clove to support. Spices are full and all well-represented, but I would love a touch more weight behind them. Grassy hops are very low and appropriately restrained. A hint of sweetness in the finish.",Boston Beer Company Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale,/review/samuel-adams-harvest-pumpkin-ale
"Big time stone fruit, especially peach, with passion fruit and a bit of mango. Pine, mint, herb, and grass in the background. Clove and pepper phenols, and light, clean wheat. Grapefruit, which builds throughout the sip, and crescendos to a bitter finish.", Moa Brewing Co. Southern Alps,/review/southern-alps
"Such big, unique hops flavors—it’s a mix of earthy, fruity, floral, citrusy, catty, dank, oniony, resin, and pine. The effect is like a hops tea with honey, as it’s sticky on the tongue. It’s milder than a pale ale, but the balance is similar in favoring hops flavor and bitterness over malt. Light wheat malt character and a creamy mouthfeel that fades into a dry, bitter finish with just a hint of sweetness.",Samuel Adams Hopscape,/review/hopscape
"Big fruit cocktail: tangerine, lemon, cherry, banana, peach, pineapple, mango. It’s hard to separate the hops from the fermentation esters. Some spicy black pepper notes. A light touch of alcohol warming toward the end of the sip. Smooth bitterness. Medium sweetness.",Transient Artisanal Ales Zero Discipline,/review/zero-discipline
"The moderate acidity in the aroma is more prevalent in the flavor. A nice clean lactic sourness is predominant, but a touch of acetic makes the moderate juicy blackberry character really pop. The sourness lingers for a while, making this a beer to sip rather than heavily indulge. A nice <em>Brett</em> barnyard complexity and pleasant malt rises over time.",The Rare Barrel Bellatrix,/review/bellatrix
"Strongly lemon and grapefruit. The alcohol is fairly present for being a single IPA, but it transitions to a smooth welcomed bitterness that embraces you like an old friend. Drys out very nicely, and the lingering bitterness fades rapidly. Medium bitterness helps accentuate the perceived citrus acidity.",Cerebral Brewing Rare Trait,/review/rare-trait
"The mango comes through well, but the hops are understated so that at first, it expresses itself as more of a mango American wheat. At the end of the swallow, a low bitterness lingers briefly, bringing forth the IPA character. Moderate sweetness, with supporting malt, if a little thin, and dry overall.",BarrelHouse Brewing Co. Mango IPA,/review/mango-ipa
"Smooth, sweet wheat malt base, with breadiness, that complements the esters of cherry and banana, but with a thin body. Just a touch of light herbal lemon hops, with a touch of orange. Moderate grassy and herbal hops, and some spicy, skunky, piney hops that lend some bitterness to balance. A hoppy resinous bitterness rounds out the finish, bringing forth a lingering hops flavor.",Breckenridge Brewery Ophelia,/review/ophelia
"The hops are aggressive, woody, spicy, dank, and come off a bit rough. Orange and grapefruit, with lime and pithy bitterness—this is pretty tart and could use more sweetness to balance. Perfumey and floral notes are woven in, but the beer still comes off a bit rough. Thick mouthfeel, with low acidity and a dry, harsh bitterness.",Stone Brewing Co. Citrusy Wit,/review/citrusy-wit
"Starts with big raspberries and cherries and a touch of sweetness that flow into tart cranberries with a very dry finish. Nice tannins from the fruit. Maybe could use just a touch more body, and some more malt complexity might help this beer carry the berry complexity into the finish.",Creature Comforts Brewery Athena Paradiso,/review/athena-paradiso
"Present, but restrained, sourness with a generous serving of <em>Brett</em> fruitiness (more fruity than funky). Moderate peach and pear with a touch of pineapple, lemon or lemongrass notes. Barely there bitterness supports a light, slightly caramel malt body that carries sour and fruit well. The aftertaste has a crisp acidity, touch of sweetness, and fruit notes that linger quite some time.","Firestone Walker Brewing Company
 Feral One",/review/feral-one
"Rich, sweet dark chocolate with cherry and vanilla throughout. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, and dark roast bring out some malted-milk ball flavors. Plenty of vanilla and oak and oak tannins, with a delicate finish of tobacco. The body is quite sweet, but dries out on the finish. This is a very big stout.",Avery Brewing Company Tweak,/review/tweak
"Bright orange citrus throughout intermingled with a complex malt character not often seen in fruited IPAs. The touch of bread crust and lightly toasted malts reminds me of orange marmalade on toast, with a hint of Grand Marnier. Not a lot of bitterness for an IPA, but some earthiness and floral hops characters. Reads a lot like an amber ale.",Terrapin Beer Company Walking Dead Blood Orange IPA,/review/walking-dead-blood-orange-ipa
"Melon and mango dominate up front, then chewy and juicy with a strong orange and pineapple presence. Finishes with a softness typical of the style. Hops are complex but there’s slightly too much bitterness to let the rest of the ingredients shine through. Medium-intense fruit flavors from hops and esters.",Exhibit 'A' Brewing Company The Cat’s Meow,/review/the-cat-s-meow
Sticky bourbon flavor with some oak and sweet cherry notes with the added sweetness of maple syrup hit up front. The oak helps to cut the sweet. Crusty bread malt sweetness is evident behind the bourbon. Sweetness coats the mouth and provides a nice lightly smoky finish.,Founders Brewing Co. Frootwood,/review/frootwood
"The fruit and hops provide big citrus flavors of grapefruit, bringing in notes of zest and pulp. The hops are bold and bitter without being harsh, with dank and citrus characteristics. The malt is bready and smooth, sweet and supportive, but relatively thin.",Ballast Point Brewing Company Grapefruit Sculpin,/review/grapefruit-sculpin
"This beer showcases the spicy and resinous hops very well while remaining juicy throughout. The citrus notes of orange, tropical pineapple, melon, and mango add a nice fruity complexity throughout the taste. Spot- on carbonation adds to the refreshing character, and the slight sweetness during the sip transitions into a mild palate-cleansing bitterness that lingers in the finish.",Weldwerks Juicy Bits,/review/juicy-bits
"Starts off with light sweetness and orange juiciness, and then becomes very tart citrus and lightly pithy. Notes of hops bitterness come in, along with lemon and lime. Strong lactic acid and bright acidity that linger in the back and on the cheeks. Salt carries throughout and is really fantastic. The finish is clean and sweet and tart, inviting you back for another sip.",Jagged Mountain Brewery Grouse Mountain Blood Orange Gose,/review/grouse-mountain-blood-orange-gose
"The resinous hops dominate the first impression, letting the berry come through in the swallow. The blackberry flavors integrate well with the citrusy hops notes, coming through as jammy. Combined with the bready and cracker malt, it’s like berry jam spread on a biscuit. Finishes dry, with berry on the aftertaste.",Anchor Brewing Blackberry Daze IPA,/review/blackberry-daze-ipa
"Chewy beer that has some complexity among the malt, barrel, and fruit.  Chocolate malt really comes through at the front with some really nice cherry sweetness in the middle. The finish is completely wood and roast.  Body is really fantastic but offers a slight alcohol warmth.",Big Boss Brewing Company Prometheus Unbound,/review/prometheus-unbound
"Strong sourness that lingers for quite some time, as well as some assertive mineral flavors that are accentuated by the carbonation. Moderate sweetness from the fruity raspberry and light grapefruit (without the sour) that has a light, pithy finish. A light salty character adds to the beer. Finishes clean and refreshing.",Exile Beatnik Sour,/review/beatnik-sour
The raspberry notes show through up front and add a nice sweetness to the taste. The raspberry sweetness mixes with a light <em>Lacto</em> tartness and a moderate salty lime flavor. There are notes of dark fruit as well with some plum and an earthy complexity. Tastes of tea. The medium body and a high carbonation bring out the tartness. Light caramel sweetness in the middle that transitions into a tart bitterness into the aftertaste.,Avery Brewing Co. Raspberry Sour,/review/Avery-raspberry-sour
"Tropical fruit throughout, especially pineapple and fruit punch, with some more subtle orange and a touch of peach/apricot. Moderate-to-high sweetness with high bitterness to offset. Fairly boozy with alcohol warmth. Tastes like a restrained West Coast IPA. The chewy body is there, but the juice-forward flavors take a backseat. Sweet for the style, but not cloying. Finishes with a touch of lingering bitterness.",Hop Butcher for the World Telehopic,/review/telehopic
"The orange-juice flavors are so strong that they almost hide a seemingly decent base IPA. The flavors are very tart, juicy, and zesty. Some resinous hops flavors that might also be from the citrus rind. A little sweetness from the malt and light-bodied, with very fresh flavor.",21st Amendment Brewery Blood Orange Brew Free or Die,/review/blood-orange-brew-free-or-die
"Big plum and raisin/date/fig really dominate up front. Bourbon and wood character provide some complexity in the middle with notes of tangerine. Malty sweetness lingers into the back, and the body coats the mouth. Mildly sweet for a BA quad. The flavors blend well, and it has a smooth tangerine citrus finish. Aftertaste: dark caramel, light vanilla, touch of citrus, light pith, big dried fruits, slight alcohol warming, light molasses.",Avery Brewing Co. Barrel-Aged Tangerine Quad,/review/barrel-aged-tangerine-quad
"The skunky hops flavor is in your face, coupled with a touch of sweet malt. A low-level pleasant bitterness, but the flavors are mild. Fruitiness of fresh apples/pears with a low level of clean maltiness. All the flavors are fairly intense on their own, but together there is some balance.",Figueroa Mountain Paradise Rd Pilsner,/review/paradise-rd-pilsner
"Cherry comes through stronger in the flavor along with raspberry, cranberry, and a bit of currant. Notes of lactic tartness hit on the tongue, with some sweetness of cherries and tartness that carry through the taste. Some acidic notes carry through on the back. Some funk. There is a nice body to this sour. Some light sweet chocolate notes add some body. Finishes slightly sweet with some tartness that leads to a fairly dry finish. Light spiciness (all-spice or clove) in the middle of the sip with a touch of sweetness. Moderate carbonation helps bring out the sourness in the cherries.",Side Project Brewing Balaton,/review/balaton
"A bold lemon tartness comes through up front. The <em>Brett</em> funk is nice and helps cut through the acidity. Nice citrus and pineapple, plus good carbonation and a clean finish. The citrus character is the star of the show, but doesn’t steal too much from the prominent, yet delicate <em>Brett</em> character.",Tired Hands Brewing Company Ourison,/review/ourison
"Light, creamy, and fruity with orange, mango, and strawberry dominating the light malt bill. The low bitterness lets the fruit character play off of the sweetness. The finish is quite sweet with almost a candy-like impression that masks some of the delicate hops notes. The carbonation seems a bit low, making the beer seem sweeter still.",Hop Butcher for the World Unwind Your Mind,/review/unwind-your-mind
"Fruity and sweet up front, with a hit of tartness that comes through as Tutti Frutti. Citrusy notes of pineapple and lemon, with raspberry and melon. Grassy notes, almost an earthy top soil note, with Brett funk and an aftertaste that rings with a hint of sweetness and an earthy, woody complexity.",Green Bench Brewing Co./Jester King Brewery Sleeping Dragon,/review/sleeping-dragon
"A wonderful blend of coffee and stout that helps you appreciate the difference between roast malt and coffee. This is clean coffee first, sweetened with caramel syrup and vanilla, with a pleasant roastiness that sneaks in near the finish and lasts. Alcohol is warming and a little spicy. The base beer has nice chocolate and toast character with vanilla from the barrel to sweeten things up a bit, then the coffee brings things together.",Copper Kettle Brewing Company Snowed In,/review/snowed-in
"Raspberry up front with a bit of stone fruit, apple, and pear. The apricot-and-raspberry character is more predominant than in the aroma. Strong puckering sour with the subtleties of the apricot and a hint of the raspberry. Wet hay and barnyard Brett. Low-to-moderate sweetness transitions into intense acidity with lactic character but also a considerable acetic presence (apple cider vinegar, almost). The pronounced acidity helps bring out the fruitiness.",Libertine Brewing Company Summer Breeze,/review/summer-breeze
"Bright and clean hops profile fades quickly into a nice, lightly sweet grainy finish. Simple and clean. Lemon tartness and light pine flavors dominate. The hops fruit character is showcased here and carries through the finish. A slight bitterness but not too bitter. Some nice warmth is present in the finish as well. Appreciable malt body leads to a long, smooth, balanced finish.",Wormtown Brewery Hopulence,/review/hopulence
"Straight up white corn tortilla with lemon lime juice. Maybe some tangerine or grapefruit. Low to moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness, low acidity. Bitterness lingers over the tongue as a lemon-mango flavor dissipates quickly. Reminds me of chewy Jolly Rancher candy but dries out on the end, ending the initial upfront sweetness quickly.",Odd13 Brewing Kaptain Kapow-Der Zero-Leaf IPA,/review/kaptain-kapow-der-zero-leaf-ipa
"Moderately sour up front with big peach sourness. A classic wild beer that tastes spontaneously fermented, with the focus on the wild bugs and less on the fruit. Juiciness from apricots and peaches, with some raspberry notes to follow. The lactic acidity is medium, with light vinegar in the background. Medium body with lots of carbonation keeps the beer refreshing and dry.",The Rare Barrel There Are Rules,/review/there-are-rules
The rich roasted quality blends well with the blackberry and <em>Brett</em> funk of straw/hay/musty cellar. The berries play a complementary role and add tartness. Finishes dry.,Cellar West Artisanal Ales God’s Eye,/review/god-s-eye
"Well balanced with noticeable hops bitterness to support the rich bread and caramel tones. Some peppery and slightly earthy hops avors. Oak and vanilla from the barrel work well with the base beer. Boozy and oxidized in a good way. Alcohol cuts the otherwise sweet body, making the beer more drinkable.",AleSmith Brewing Company Barrel-Aged Old Numbskull,/review/barrel-aged-old-numbskull
"Moderate sweetness up front with notes of honey or light molasses, which extend into the aftertaste with notes of banana and a little plum. Nice dried apricot flavor. Light bitterness in the background. Medium carbonation with a moderate body and a slight alco- hol note toward the end that is complementary. The bitterness-to-sweetness balance is spot on.",Bières de Chimay Chimay Red,/review/chimay-red
Extremely reminiscent of canned pineapple-orange juice without the extreme tartness. Bready malt balance is well executed letting the hops shine without allowing the lingering bitterness to overwhelm things. A chewy texture on the end but not heavy.,Offshoot Beer Co.
